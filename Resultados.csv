We had the most amazing experience on the luxury sailing excursion. The crew made sure we had the best time and kept us safe and happy throughout the whole trip. The drinks were plentiful and food and snacks were perfect for a trip on the sea. The boat was beautiful and clean. The whole experience was top notch from pick up to drop off we didnât have to worry about a thing. We will only book excursions from them for all our future trips to Cabo and was honestly the highlight of our vacation. I highly recommend them and this particular excursion.,sea
"The sunset cruise is amazing! Gorgeous views of the ocean, the rocks, and the arch and there are tons of stingrays to see. Tomas, our guide, was very warm and welcoming and had a great sense of humor. I highly recommend this activity. A little word of advice try to be one of the first to board the boat so you can get a seat right up front. We were able to stretch out and lay down which the made the experience much more romantic and relaxing!",sea
"Sea of Cortez (Gulf of. California) Trip

Jun 2023

We enjoyed our day so much! We were impressed by the boat ans the day. The crew was top notch: warm, kind and fun. Food and drinks were available all day. We snorkeled and toured around the islands. It was a fun day for sure and would absolutely recommend it. Note, it is a long day and bus ride. We packed some dry clothes to make it more comfortable.

Crew: Mario, Jorge, Carlo, Joe, Junior","sea, cortez"
"Very fun snorkeling/water sports experience and well priced. Harbor and run out to the arch was beautiful and snorkeling/kayaking/sea scooter were all great. Captain and guide were super accommodating and fun.Went in Feb so the ocean was a little cold. We opted to not wear wetsuits which was fine for me but if you get cold easily, you may want one. Upside is that it was whale season, so we saw humpbacks jumping.They fed us at the end which was an appreciated surprise. Overall very worth it!",sea
"Wonderful experience boating to some of the most beautiful areas. We saw seals, whales, massive tuna, and more. We stopped at Santa Maria Beach to snorkel, paddle board, and relax & leisure. I saw the biggest school of fish in my life at Santa Maria and there must've been 50k fish swarming together. Our crew members Jaros, Cpt. Pablo, Hillary, and Andy were great. They made sure everyone had a great time, they fed us well, and they made amazing drinks for us. We didn't get to sail cause of low winds, but they made up by tracking down some whales nearby so we could whale watch.","beach, sea, santa maria"
"The team here are outstanding! We booked with Oscar and dove with Chalo! Wow! We felt so comfortable with the whole experience. My wife had dove before many times but this was a first for me. We both had such a great experience! We saw lots of different fish, yellow tails, puffer fish, sea lions and much more! It was worth every penny! So much so, weâre already planning our next trip back. See you soon!",sea
Cabo Adventures offers various tours and attractions at a fairly decent price. I took a boating tour of the surrounding beach areas which included a stop to swim in the ocean and lunch and drinks.  Very enjoyable,beach
"My husband and I booked the Whale Watching, Famous Arch, Sea Lions and tour through Cabo Adventures. Our expectations were exceeded! We saw so many whales that were close to our boat...and learned really interesting and fun facts about whales and other sea life! We had such a fun adventure on the large inflatable raft and were even able to hear whale sounds with a hydrophone. The guides were wonderful, we felt very safe, guides were friendly and informative. Razz, provided really great information to us. The captain, Nelson, and photographer, Fernando, were great as well. We only wish our entire family was with us to enjoy this amazing experience! This excursion was the highlight of our Pacific Coastal cruise!",sea
We had a great time on the boat! Emi and team were a fun bunch! The drinks were refreshing and the boat just beautiful. Snorkeling was fun and the water was a great temperature in the sea of Cortez. I liked the ride and scenery the most. ð¤,"sea, cortez"
"We enjoyed the Luxury Sunset cruise, which was 10/10 amazing! Great food, staff, boat! We even saw whales! We also did the snorkel tour! Again a solid 10/10! The tour guide was fantastic and we saw so many fish and sea creatures and stopped for whales on the way back! Would do both again!",sea
"This is an adventure that everyone visiting Cabo San Lucas should experience. And I do mean experience, because this is more than just a tour, itâs an experience. The reservations with the booking agent at the resort weâre staying were easy and quick. The transportation to and from the resort was friendly and hassle-free.  The food and drinks (virtually unlimited) were fresh, cold, and most enjoyable. The boat crew who attended to us did so with outstanding service. Seeing whales and dolphins in the water were not part of our expectations, but when the crew spotted several humpback whales in the water, they slowed down so everyone could experience the thrill of seeing the whales jump out of the water. That was quite an experience. When we arrived at the cove to snorkel, the crew very clearly explained to everyone how to do it and individually helped those folks who had a bit of hesitation. Great service there. On the return trip to the marina the crew raised raised the sails on the boat for a 20 minute sail. There wasnât much wind, but it was still cool to be sailing in Sea of Cortez. Overall a great experience. Thank you crew and staff.","sea, cortez"
"We were very fortunate to have a wonderful guide, Isaac, for our Electric Bike Beach Adventure. Also we were in a small group of only three. We felt very safe as we explored various sandy paths with winding and twisty spots. One of us was more adventurous and was guided to attempt more but we all rode at our own comfort level. The scenery is gorgeous and the photos taken by the photographer who always found the right spot to catch us in action were definitely âmust havesâ. We highly recommend this adventure and hope you get a guide as friendly and expert as Isaac.",beach
"Was a fun day with drinks and lunch and whales! Very knowledgeable guide... saw the arch , sea lions, pelicans, & whales. Beautiful clean boat too!  Highly recommend ....",sea
Whale watching in Cabo was an amazing experience. We saw about 5 whales and the boat ride on the Pacific ocean relaxing by the arches was amazing. We were up so close to them. Divorce and Lovers Beach was beautiful from the boat view -,"beach, lovers"
"The four of us had an absolute blast yesterday on the âluxury sailing Cabo tourâ! Jesus, the photographer (Mariela), and captain were absolutely amazing. They docked the sailboat at a bay where we could snorkel and see a beautiful variety of fishes. The food they served was delicious!We were celebrating our best friendâs 30th birthday and she lost her phone (in a waterproof container for pictures) when she was getting out of the water â The string had broken off. Jesus was a sweetheartâdove down and found it. A day that could have turned for worse was saved. Weâre so grateful that Jesus (see photo) went out of his way to make sure we were okay and all enjoying ourselves. Thank you, Jesus!On the way back, we saw whale, dolphins, and seals. The captain and Jesus carefully maneuvered the sails which was an awesome experience in which we felt safe and well protected.Afterwards, Mariela showed us the photos she took which were AMAZING!All in all, we highly recommend this company and crew! In fact, weâre going back two days later for the sunset crew!Note: bring a sweater and sunblock! ð",sea
"we had an absolute blast! felt more like whale CHASING because you get to go so fast to see them!  Franco, our guide, was fantastic! saw sea lions, humpback whales, grey whales, dolphins, manta-rays -- amazing",sea
"Went on the ""Whale Watching Photo Safari"". Fantastic tour guide, very funny, welcoming and informative. Only improvement could be fresh padding on the seats, a little bumpy!",sea
"My husband, Friend & I went on 3 different Cabo Adventures. We loved each of them, but really enjoyed the zip line and the whale watching on the Catamaran. Our zip line guides; Jesus, Ladis, Jonathan, Dionex & Arturo were beyond amazing! The views were awesome and the Superman zip line was well worth it!I was afraid that I would get sea sickness on the whale tour, but on the Catamaran I had no sickness and enjoyed every moment. Our Captain and main guide, both Jorge were great! We saw lots of whales and they even put a microphone in the water and we got to listen to the whale songs! I would definitely recommend Cabo Adventures!",sea
"Every time we are in Los Cabos we take advantage of all the activities Cabo-Adventures offers. Isla EspÃ­ritu Santo(Sea of Cortez) itâs one that I can really recommend. Amazing views land and sea, most times depending the time of the year while on board of the Catamaran you are going to be able enjoy the views and see different birds, dolphins, whales, and if lucky while snorkelling you might be able to see other sea creatures. When not in mating season you are able to snorkel with leones/lobos marinos (sea lions) @ a short distance from Isla EspÃ­ritu Santo. A big thank you to everyone involved with all the activities from Cabo-Adventures but a special thank you to the entire crew from EspÃ­ritu Santo, big thanks to Capitan Jorge that under his command the catamaran is always safe, also a big thanks to my amiga PaceÃ±a Karla that makes us feel at home while on board, and last but not least to my brother from a different mother Ruziel Lopez that I always make sure he is going to be part of the tour to Isla EspÃ­ritu Santo before booking the day of the tour, because Ruz is the best in all aspects, he makes sure you are 100% satisfied with your day, abrazo mi hermano.","sea, cortez"
We took the electric bike beach adventure. It was so much fun and our tour guide Pepe was amazing. He explained every detail of the adventure. After we had lunch and made margaritas. They were so tasty! Highly recommend!,beach
Chicas did a wonderful job! Had so much riding camels by the beach. Great experience,beach
"Had the best time on the Sunset Cruise on the Sea of Cortez. Saw whales, sting ray, otters, and dolphins! It was surreal.","sea, cortez"
"I booked an excursion with the Cabo adventures group for a two tank certified scuba dive. This was my first ocean dive after my certification, so this was my 2nd dive, with my first being in a rock quarry. The Cabo Team made me feel comfortable and confident in my certification training. Sylvia the dive guide was great and knowledgeable about the wildlife. We went over the dive plan and all of the potential marine life we might see which we did see almost everything that was mentioned. The group was able to swim with the sea lions and we seen stone fish, moray eels, turtles, and many other fish. I would highly recommend this dive trip for any diver going to Cabo.",sea
"Whale Watching Photo Safari was incredible and a  must- do in Cabo if you are there during whale watching season! Our guide, Mario, was incredibly knowledgeable. Our captain, Nelson, was amazing at spotting whales!",sea
"We did the snorkel, paddleboard, kayak and water scooter tour. The tour includes pickup from your hotel. On our tour, we took the banana boat speedboat out to Chileno Bay. That ride is about 40mins, and you pass by all the huge mansions. On the way out from the marina, we rode by the Arch of Los Cabos, Lover's Beach, Divorce Beach, Scooby Doo rock, and where the Sea of Cortez meets the Pacific Ocean(Land's End). Me & my wife decided to kayak in the Sea of Cortez, after realizing snorkeling was tough due to the strong waves. Kayaking was fun. I appreciated that we snorkeled in an area where it wasn't crowded with other tours. Equipment is in decent to good shape, but the sea scooter isn't as fast as you think. The crew was nice. A great tour for the price. We had cheese quesadillas at the end, which was more like a snack. The marina facility is pretty big.","beach, sea, cortez, divorce beach, land's end"
Emmy and his crew were amazing!! We had the best time on our snorkeling trip. They not only had a lot of facts to share about Cabo but also about the sea life in the area. The food and drinks were also really good. I would definitely recommend!,sea
"Love the camel ride tour.  Riding on beautiful tall camel walking by the gorgeous beach is a satisfactory experience.  Saul is a great guide, full of humor and energy, bringing the tour full of fun.",beach
"Took the sailing trip with one bay of snorkeling. Crew was GREAT! Tou start off with a mimosa or orange juice, then open bar once you hit the ocean. You are also fed on the way out to the bay and on the way back. They take you out by the arch, loverâs beach, etc on the way out. Went to a bay that wasnât very crowded for some paddle boarding and snorkeling. It was a nice day on the ocean and, again, the crew was awesome. We didnât buy the photos at the end. They wanted $114 USD.",beach
"The Sea of Cortez adventure is an amazing full day excursion. Picked us up at our resort and shuttled us up to La Paz. The tour is on a large catamaran for smooth sailing. The staff was fun and friendly. The food was delicious, although my two teens thought breakfast could have been more. Most importantly, the dives sites are beautiful and teeming with life.","sea, cortez"
"We did 2 tours with Cabo Adventures and they were both amazing.1st we did a private sailing trip. Jesus was our guide, Bruno was the captain, and Mariella was the photographer. We had so much fun. The drinks were flowing, the snack boxes were good, and Jesus was a great DJ. The wind wasn't blowing much but they still put out the sails which was so calming and amazing. Highly recommend.Next we did the luxury whale watching and I believe Jose was our guide. The luxury whale watching was nice because it was a cool catamaran and you didn't have to wear life jackets but the downside is the boats can't get as close to the whales. We saw quite a few pods of whales and even a baby which they said was the first they've seen this season. Jose was so genuine and knowledgeable about whales that it made it even better.I don't think you could go wrong with Cabo adventures.I personally wouldn't do the swim with dolphins but that my personal issue with dolphins in enclosures.",sea
"I ended up liking this company slightly better than Cactus Tours. I took the luxury day sailing and jet ski tours with Cabo Adventures. I was impressed with how smoothly the process from check in to adventure went. The tour guides were kind and skilled. The equipment was modern and in good condition. There was never any undue pressure to purchase pictures or additional items.

The luxury day sailing tour was my favorite. Food was pretty good, but the drinks were even better! We saw many humpback whales and seals.

The jet ski adventure is not for everyone. It was certainly memorable, but those are very rough seas! Dont expect to be full speed ahead. It was still well ran and I cannot discount the rating of the tour company based on the conditions of the water.",sea
"We did two adventuresSnorkeling at Cabo Pulmo and the Luxury Sailing Your and both were awesome!! I'd recommend these tours to adults over 18 and wouldn't recommend children under 17, but I'm just being fickle because it was far more ""adventurous and fun"" with adults! The only regret, I didn't take a Go-Pro!!! The sailing trip was freaking awesome; I think we were on boat #2, and Saul was a hit, ""you signed up for sailing, and we are going to sail""!!The snorkeling adventure at Pulmo was fantastic, saw sharks, sea turtles, and everything else!!! We spent a lot of time in the water, and it was well worth the 2-hour drive!!!",sea
"Our guide was determined for us to see the whales breaching - and we saw them multiple times. He had great stories about the area and the beaches. We were an hour late for our reservation due to a long lunch and they were super accommodating.The boat was in need of a few repairs and we were soaked, but the friendliness of our boat captain and his stellar tour made up for the state of the boat.",beach
"After having been on several snorkeling excursions all over the world, I can honestly say that this one was hands down the best. From start to finish this company is a well-oiled machine. We were picked up on-time from our hotel in an air conditioned van, everyone was masked up & the driver was super friendly.   The crew was exceptional and really made this tour memorable. They were incredibly attentive & knowledgeable. We had the privilege of seeing several whales on our way back in and they took the time to stop and let everyone experience it (one of the whales appeared out of nowhere RIGHT BESIDE THE BOAT! Absolute highlight of 2021). The crew were also very excited about the whales which was very refreshing. The photographer took a ton of pictures throughout the day & they turned out great. You always had a drink in your hand & the lunch they provided was fresh and delicious. I had a bit of a mishap with the sea scooter (my bikini top got stuck in the propeller in the water ð) and the crew handled it super professionally and discreetly. Thank you so much to JosÃ©, Joel, Jacob & Roberto, you guys killed it, we will 100% recommend this tour to our friends & family and weâll be back in the future. Wishing you the best for the future & we hope you have a great new year!",sea
"We did the boat ride to the arches and camel ride excursion combo.  Maxwell was an awesome guide and knew so much the history and geography of the marina, beaches, and history.  My wife and I spent the afternoon with Isaac and the camels.  Great time, great food-Isaac was very knowledgeable, was enthusiastic about what he was doing.  He loves these animals!  Would recommend this tour, but bring water and snacks.",beach
"We did the sea of cortes tour and it was great. Though, it took 2hrs to get to the boat and back, it was definitely worth the trip. Brought us where the seals are with plenty of fish. I wish i had camera under water that works then i could have taken a lot of pics.",sea
"Very disappointing tour! Cabo Adventures check in staff was very friendly and attentive. But it all changed when we got onboard the sailboat with captain Erick. The tour was supposed to last 2 and a half hours, but captain Erick returned our sailboat to the Pier, after only 1 hour 45 minutes!! He offered to sail through Sea of Cortes, but Ã­nstead he kept the boat in a still position for long periods of time. I thought the purpose of the tour was to sail!! During these long periods of nothing, my son wanted to film with his drone. Once again, captain Erick very rudely didnât allow him to do so with no valid explanation. Suddenly my daughter saw whales nearby. We asked captain Erick if we could go a little closer to see them. He answered rudely that our tour was not a whale-watching tour, and that he would be late for our return. Late?? He cut off our tour 45 minutes earlier!!! The bright side of our experience, was that we did get to see other whales on our way back. This actually improved our overall experience. Finally it was very uncomfortable having EstÃ©ban (the other staff member) helping you get off the boat with one hand and holding a hat in his other hand while DEMANDING VERY RUDELY that he was expecting a tip!! (Which he of course didnât receive at all). Is this a luxury sailing experience?? I seriously doubt it!!",sea
"We visited Cabo in early May and booked 3 adventures with Cabo Adventures - Luxury Sailing, Camel Combo (Camels, ATV, & Eco Farm), and Dolphin Trainer for a Day

The Luxury Sailing Tour was great! The captain and crew were experts and knew exactly what they were doing. Saul was part of the crew and he was fantastic! I cannot remember the captain's name, but he was great, too. Rocsi, the photographer, was also nice. Please note, however, if you've never been sailing, the boat tips A LOT when the sails go up. I had never been sailing and didn't know what to expect. Thankfully, I was able to sit in the back of the boat during the sailing portion (which was only about 45 mins-1 hour of the whole 4 hour experience) because I was not particularly fond of the sailing. But overall it was still a great experience, and you receive a snack, lunch, and unlimited drinks.

The Camel Combo was awesome! Be aware this tour is about an hour away from Cabo, so factor in travel time if you make other plans for the day. You first tour the Eco Farm and learn about how they recycle plastics from all over, and also how they make chocolate. Isha was a great tour guide. Then you take a short ride on the camels on the beach. It was so much fun. We also go to take pictures with Jefferson the Camel. I can't remember our camel guides name, but he was younger and gave us so much great information about the camels! Finally, we got to ride on the ATVs. Our guides Bryan and Noriega were fantastic. We had an awesome time, and we also had a tequila tasting at the end. I forget our photographer's name (he was shorter and had curly hair), but he was fantastic! I would say he took the best photos from all of our experiences with Cabo Adventures.

The Dolphin Trainer for a Day Experience was THE BEST! It is WELL worth the money, and I recommend this dolphin experience over all the others. You definitely get more for your money doing the Dolphin Trainer for a Day. When we arrived we received a free t-shirt and hat before immediately going to learn about the dolphins. We learned how they are checked every morning to make sure they are healthy, have an appetite, and if they want to participate with people that day. If the dolphins don't want to participate, they aren't forced to. It is their choice each day if they want to interact with guests, and they are never punished. We toured the facility and learned how the dolphins were taken care of, what they eat, how the water is filtered, etc. We got to swim with the dolphins, help train one of the baby dolphins, and then learn commands and work with the dolphins one-on-one. Our trainer Paola was AMAZING and a great trainer. Lunch is also included in this package. The photo packages are SUPER expensive for this experience, however, they say the money goes back into caring for the dolphins. So be prepared to spend money on the photos if you want them. We bought them because it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Overall, Cabo Adventures is great, and we will definitely book with them again if we're ever in Cabo again! We bought the photo packages at each experience and went in with the mindset of buying the photo packages, so we made sure to put aside extra money for that ahead of time. We did not feel hassled for tips like some other comments mentioned, but we did tip all of our guides, photographers, and transportation drivers because they all provided excellent service. I highly recommend Cabo Adventures for any of their experiences when you visit Cabo!",beach
"Just got back from Cabo for my birthday trip. We booked a snorkeling with whale sharks experience, but unfortunately it was cancelled due to sea conditions. Cabo Adventures was very accommodating letting us (a group of 4) choose a different activity and refunded the difference in price. We did the ATVs and camel ride with lunch and it was great! They even did a little tequila tasting with lunch. Everything was well organized and we still saw humpback whales from the shore during our camel ride. Hopefully we can try again another time for whale shark snorkeling. Would definitely book a tour with these guys again.",sea

We did the Cabo Adventure Luxury Day Sailing. The tour takes you by the famous Arch of Cabo and a nice day of sailing along the coast and stopping at the Santa Maria Bay to get off and enjoy the water. The tour was fantastic.,santa maria
Highly recommend!!  We booked the day sailing and snorkeling trip.  From the minute you step on the boat you are taken care of.   We were given some mimosa.  Kids got the choice of a juice.  It was whale mating season so lots of activity in the water and we were able to get up close and personal with the whales.  Food that was made was delicious!,sea
"Booked the luxury private snorkeling boat tour with Cabo adventures for my friends joint bachelor and bachelorette party, I always do a lot of research before booking things especially in another country. The booking process and staff were extremely friendly and quick to respond. They answered all my questions. They were on time and someone was there every step of the way to guide us until the end of the boat tour. This was the best boat experience I have ever had and the bridal party even complimented me and said I did a good job planning but it was really the staff at cabo adventures that made this experience! Shout out to our crew Mario, Lukas, Johnny, Vianet! They were so professional and nice. They had a lot of patience with our big group of 16 people. I really felt safe on the boat with them. The boat was super clean and the food was delicious and served so nicely. They also served us endless drinks! Thank you again and will be sure to come back next time!",sea
"Had a great time on the luxury day sailing tour this weekend! Mario (our tour guide) was very upbeat and informative definitely set the tone for a great day. Pablo (our captain) was professional and found us some excellent whale watching. And Victoria (the photographer) was enthusiastic, talented, and kind. The four hour tour felt like it had a little of everything; we cruised by the arch and went swimming in the Santa Maria Bay. Easily one of the best experiences from our weekend in Cabo!",santa maria
"What an incredible trip!! Iâm arriving back to my hotel after a day of swimming with whale sharks, eating delicious food, and making new friends. This is my 3rd trip with Cabo Adventures and this company always delivers unforgettable experiences. The whale shark tour was planned seamlessly, our guides Michelle, Jose and Mario were whale shark experts teaching us tons about the whale sharks and the environment around us. Cant recommend the whale shark tour enough as well as all the other Cabo Adventures trips.â¦and we got incredible pictures and videos of it all ð¤©",sea
"Cabo Adventures was amazing!! We went on the 3 hour snorkel tourRichie was so funny and an awesome tour guide!!! Highly recommend Richie! The Captain was Auroleio, he made the ride so much fun!! They took us right by the love island and divorce island. We saw seals up close and beautiful turtles in the water. Our photographer was Jorge, captured an amazing video of my husband and I with the fish. You have an option to pay for thosePictures and videos after the tour. Lastly, we were fed quesadillas, delicious!!! We will be coming back and requesting those men again!!",sea
"Really well organized. Staff were knowledgeable and friendly. They went above and beyond to make sure the day was fantastic.

A pod of about 200 dolphins went by and we got to hang out with them too!!",sea
"Cabo Adventures are pros at what they do. I booked the snorkeling tour where we were taken from the marina around to Chileno Bay. On the way we were able to see some jumping sting rays as well as a whale breaching the water. They provided all the gear for us to snorkel at at Chileno Bay, and we were also able to kayak, paddle board and even use those underwater diving scooters. On the way back we drove the boat around to see El Arco, Land's End, Lover's Beach, Divorce Beach & Neptune's Finger. All in all a great tour.","beach, divorce beach, land's end"
We are so glad we chose to go on the Electric Bike Beach Adventure & Ecofarm tour with Cabo Adventures. The biking was so much fun & our guide Isaac was the best!   He was funny & eager to show us a good time. He made sure we were comfortable with the bikes and answered any questions we had. The area is very scenic and we had plenty of stops to take it all in. This tour definitely exceeded our expectations!,beach
"We booked a whale-watching tour with Cabo Adventures through the concierge at our resort.  We chose the 2-hour tour on a small inflatable raft that held about 18 people on bench seats.  Their headquarters are conveniently located at the Cabo marina -- staff were friendly and helpful and the facilities were clean and comfortable while we waited for our tour to begin.  Once your group is called, it's a short walk to a nearby pier where life vests are distributed and you board the raft.  The ride itself was smooth and pleasant (don't bother wearing a hat unless it's securely tied on) and the raft was clean and well maintained. At the beginning, they stopped at The Arch for a photo opp, which was a nice bonus.  Our tour guide seemed knowledgable and was able to answer any question we threw his way -- we especially appreciated the fact that this organization respects the environment and the whales themselves.  While we didn't see any dramatic whale leaps during our tour, we saw plenty of breaches and a few small jumps.  Definitely recommend this operator -- very fun.",sea
"We chose the luxury whale watching, our guide Jose was amazing, very hospitable crew. Just an overall amazing experience with the fancy wait area and the nice yatch. We saw a lot of humpback whales( even a breach), dolphins and even a sea turtle. Highly recommend this experience with Cabo Adventures! They were the best based on both my prior research, and experience.",sea
"Couldnât say enough nice things about this adventure! We did the camel ride + ATV trip, and had a blast. You get to get up close and personal with some adorable camels, and your ride takes you right along the beach. Isha, our camel guide, was knowledgeable and friendly. The second part of our tour did not disappoint! We rode ATVs with Alain, and he was so much fun. The ATV ride weaves you in and out of some beautiful Mexican landscapes, and we saw lots of wildlife along the way. He kept it fun, and then hung out with  us while we did a tequila tasting and gave us all kind of interesting info about the area and tequila. Definitely a unique experience that we will remember forever. Thank you, Isha and Alain!",beach
"My family and I did the Luxury Whale Watching experience last month and loved every minute of it! The staff was friendly, responsive, and worked hard to ensure everyone had a fun and safe time. The light lunch provided was tasty and fresh, and the staff kept the drinks coming.The highlight of the trip, of course, was the sea life. We saw flying fish, sea lions, dolphins, and three humpback whales - all with the beautiful backdrop of the setting sun. Worth every penny and a lot of fun for older kids and adults!",sea
We had a great experience! The camel ride  along the beach was fabulous. We saw a few whales too! The lunch was delicious and Jorge was the best guide and super knowledgeable about the tequilas we tasted.,beach
We had a great time but the only reason I booked this excursion was because my son wanted to do sea scooters and I guess they were broke down. Otherwise my son had a great time.,sea
"We got to see the whales and the boat was beautiful. We sat upstairs in the comfy seats and had great views. Yummy mimosas with fresh OJ. The âgourmet lunchâ was just sandwiches, it was a lovely half day at Sea!",sea
Person who sold our trip completely lied about the experience.    We were to have private transportation with direct travel.  Instead we were put on a charter bus that had 4 stops prior to leaving.  When our trip was over we couldn't leave for an hour until other people could fill the bus on the return.    The Polaris adventure was awefull.  They said it was two hours and we would go through rivers and ride on the beach.  The river was homemade and we never got to ride on the beach. The ride was only one hour and then one hour at a restaurant.  Worst experience ever.Once our charter bus filled up we had to make 4 more stops letting people off.   We spend 3 hours on a bus and one hour on our polaris.   Avoid this company at all costs.,beach
Passed on paying $138 per person for the Carnival cruise excursion and did this one for $30 per person (after haggling of course) and bought our own lunch and drinks in an air conditioned restaurant. This tour took us around lands end and stopped at several beaches. Came back to get us after spending an hour on one beach.,beach
"Overall, we really enjoyed the whale watching activity. We saw several humpbacks and a gray whale. A baby humpback kept breaching near us as it seemed to be in a playful mood. Between the yacht and the captain, the y kept the ride pleasant even though the water was a little turbulent at times. I never felt the least bit seasick or unsafe. The crew did a good job of keeping everyoneâs glass full, however I will say  the lunch was nothing exceptional. The tour guide was knowledgeable, but sometimes he was hard to understand because he talked very fast and had a thick accent when speaking English. After we had seen numerous whales, they put a listening device in the water so we could hear the whales communicating, but it did not work. It was a great experience but there were some areas for potential improvement.",sea
"I did 2 tours with cabo adventures , snorkeling and electric beach biking snorkeling was great, had several helpers, water was murky and its a bit crowded with other tours so you have to watch out for other boats, beach biking was not what I was expecting as we were dessert mountain biking really, I wouldnt take anyone under 14 on it and if youre older make sure you are in great shape, I fell twice second time I fell into the handle bars and still bruise and hurt today, the guides kept asking if I was ok even when I said I wasnt but I pushed through the rest and got an ice pack in the end, enjoyed it overall but wouldnt do the bike  ride again. definitely would book with cabo adventures when im back",beach
"We did the Sea of Cortez tour, and we were generally happy with the tour.The way from San Lucas to the Sea of Espirito Santo Islan is exhausting; 2.5 hours drive, and another two hours cruise to the Sea Lions' colony. But from that moment, we were in paradise.We did snorkeling with the Sea Lions, which was one of the most magical experiences I had. The bay was beautiful, the visibility was great and there were lots of fish and cutie Sea Lion babies that swam very close to us.We then went up to the yacht where the tour guide and the crew served fresh lunch of nachos, sandwiches and ceviche, and we enjoyed the open bar, which was part of the package deal we bought.On the way back to La Paz, the yacht made an hour stop at on of bays of Espirito Santo Island. We snorkeled at the green and beautiful water there, played on the floating mattress and enjoyed the sun and the beautiful view.Our tour guide was very professional and nice. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that on the way back, the tour guide decided to make an unplanned stop at a local taco restaurant / supermarket / kiosk - not sure what this place was.","sea, cortez"
Went snorkeling with the sea lions with this place. It was an amazing day and they take care of everything! Our guide Razz was awesome,sea
"EBike tour with margaritas making, April 1st.Wonderful ride and tour by guide Issac and crew.  First time on an ebike, good instructions and easy to ride. Loved the trail ride and the beach ride was fun.  Wanted to go around again.  Photographer was excellent.  The luncheon was delicious, and the margaritas making very informative and interesting.Highly recommend it.  Our van driver is also very friendly and drive safely.",beach
I had the pleasure of doing the luxury day cruise and man it was a blast.  They had 10 people go at a time for the day cruise and even had 2 meals on board with unlimited drinks. It was awesome!You will sail to santa maria beach where you can do water activities like snorkeling and paddle boarding.If you're lucky then they will hook you up with a sunset cruise and it was just a great experience for the price.I would highly recommend this place,"beach, santa maria"

We had the best experience possible and were overjoyed by how kind and fun the staff were. We rode camals, rode our atv's through the desert while overlooking a beautiful beach, went snorkeling and seen all the fascinating sealife and last but not least! swam with the dolphins, which was an absolute dream of mine    we were amazed by our wonderful trainer Dujon, the beautiful Fernanda to capture the photos and ofcource our dolphin, Gandalf!!! I did this on my birthday and it made my entire day so much more special ð this was a vacation we will never forget, thanks to you're teams ability to strive for perfection and ensure all the guests leave with a huge smile on there face. Thank you so much! ð","beach, sea"
"This crew was excellent. They took us up close to the arch and showed us the lovers/divorced beaches on the ride out to find the whales. In total, we saw 5 humpbacks. We were able to get some really impressive photos. They also had a photographer on the boat who also took amazing photos that we could purchase. They were alot of fun and had extensive knowledge.","beach, lovers"
"We did the swim with whale sharks adventure. We were very pleased with the entire trip, and enjoyed it from start to finish. Oliver and Raz did a fantastic job. A morning snack (basically a full lunch) was provided on the way to La Paz, while they went over alot of facts and stories about the adventure and the surrounding area we were in. This was followed by a video about the Baja of California. Once in La Paz we got geared up and walked to the marina to board our boats.The trip had 18 ppl on it, so we took 2 boats out. We were surprised to learn how controlled this trip is with checking and getting registered to even get out to the area where the sharks are, to only allowing so any boats to be in the designated area, only 4 ppl allowed in the water at a time with the whale shark, each boat can only spend a max of 30mins with the whale shark as well. Mind you the local tour guides don't always seem to follow these rules.It was a beautiful day, and it was only the 2nd weekend of the season for the whale shark trip. There were only 2-3 whale sharks in our area. We got to swim with the same one on 2 different dives, and it was absolutely amazing to be in the water with these huge creatures. It was really breathtaking. Unfortunately the water was pretty cloudy, bit that also forced us to get within a few feet of them. The water was warm, and I was a glorious day, we even got to swim with a pod if dolphins.After the trip we rinsed off at the Cabo Adventures facility, and headed to a local restaurant for a tasty meal. From there we headed back to Cabo.",sea
"The Cabo Adventure Whale Watching tour was AWESOME!!Our guide, Franco, was very knowledgeable about whales, the history of the area and landmarks, with a great attitude. Our Captain, Jose ""Muneco,"" was an excellent whale tracker, sea captain and nice guy, with good taste in music for the upbeat trip back to port. Jorge, our talented photographer, got the whales, people and scenery shots, with such perfect timing, that he was able to catch all the details that no one else would have managed to anticipate so precisely. It was much more than I expected, and a truly wonderful experience.",sea

Professional Pictures are taken throughout tour and you return to marina after sun set.Upon returning you have option to purchase your professionally taken photos. You recieve options to having selected photos printed and/or remaining sent to your phone via USB to your phone. The cost is under $100.00 U.S.Go with a group of friends.

"For the dolphin experience, it was awesome. Sailing was pretty cool, too. But, they have larger boats. If you want to get up close with the seals and pelicans, you need to get on one of those tiny fishing boats. Overall, I did two things with them while I was in Cabo San Lucas, and I really enjoyed both.",sea
"We had a wonderful whale watching excursion with Cabo Adventures. They really went out of their way to make it a great experience. Jerry, our guid was knowledgeable, friendly and humorous.  Jerry took the time to share with me other locations to visit in Mexico. Our boat Captian, was also great. I also appreciated the companies respect for the environment and sea life.",sea
Bad fishing as we had lines in the water for 4 of the 5 hour trip and not 1 bite.  But we saw a dolphin pod and humpback whales and fed 2 sea lions,sea
"We did the Snorkel & Sea Adventure with guide Alex and photographer Jonathan and captain Danny (I think?) They were great and really nice and friendly, so easy going, spokeEnglish and Spanish amazingly well. They explained a lot about what to expect, safety protocols, and showed us El Arco, land's ends, Neptune's finger, Lover's beach and Divorce beach, and then took us (cruising at a pretty fast rate!) to Chilleno Bay, a beach where we could snorkel, kayak, and paddle board. Jonathan the photographer took pics the whole time that were available after the excursion for purchase. When we were finished and back at the marina, I was pleasantly surprised that ceviche and chips and drinks were made available to us. I was really impressed with our guide Alex and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Cabo!","beach, sea, divorce beach, land's end"
"This should be the NUMBER ONE adventure company is Cabo on Trip Advisor! Our experience was above all expectations for the Sea of Cortes and the Outdoor Adventure. I surprised my wife with these two adventures and she has said over and over it was the best part of the trip. Even during COVID, the experience was unforgettable and there were less people than normal on the transportation and activities.Both crews were excellent Spanish and English speakers so all our questions were adequately answered and there were zero hidden fees from the website. Both crews were nice and got to know us and our names which were used throughout the whole day. Gear and equipment were high end and you can feel a strong importance for your safety. The food was great as well! The pick up from our hotel was right on time and they let us park for free at their marina l option when we were arriving but before check in. All in all I would do this again in a heartbeat and with the current 30% off discount, itâs so worth it!Shout out to Nico at the Outdoor Adventure for all the laughs.",sea
They brought us from our hotel to the marina and then told us our boat tour and jet skis are cancelled. Then made us wait for more than 30 mins to get us a ride back to our hotel. They were not sorry and I had to really force the.to get us back to the hotel so we don't waste our time at their establishment just to go back. Overall a terrible experience. I rather deal with vendors directly on the beach than these guys at Cabo adventure which is supposed to be a big company.,beach
"Absolutely loved this adventure. Our tour team and captain  were AWESOME (Danny was Capt. I forget the ladies names, but they were all exceptional). When we return we will definitely voyage with this company and request this crew again!! They translated everything in both spanish and english smoothy with total ease. They made sure the both sides of the boat saw all the different landmarks, and sea life comfortably. They had a great awareness of their guests needs and rose to the occasion of accomodations. Definitely go with Cabo Adventures if quality is key for your experiences.",sea
"Mario, Luiz and Jesus on the snorkel adventure were just amazing.   Would recommend this trip to anyone.  Seeing the whale just topped off the whole experience.  Snorkeling with the fish unbelievable and the colony of sealions incredible.",sea
"We had an absolute blast at this location with this company. Let me start by saying that we are certified scuba divers. We purchased a two-tank dive for $100. Since we have advanced diving certifications we received a private tour with our dive Master dive instructor Liz. She was fantastic. The photographer was pretty amazing as well. He is also a divemaster and dive instructor. We got to dive in the arches and through a canyon, covering both the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific Ocean all-in-one dive. If that wasn't enough, we had sea lions playing around us and then a whale shark circled us. Several times. It was absolutely amazing. And on the final part of the dive we had a wreck and we were able to look at. Truly the best dive ever. Not to mention puffer fish, trumpet fish, urchins, sea snake, octopus, and dozens of other types of fish. The photographer took pictures of all of this and it is a great memory for us. The second dive was quite nice. We saw a lot of the same items even though we dove in a different area.","sea, cortez"

Today we took a fun, wonderful relaxing camel ride along the beaches and then pictures with the camels. The staff were kind, good ans informed us well. Pepe gave us great info. We had a delicious Mexican lunch! Best part was the tequila cheers and drinking. Muchoa Gracias Pepe. Much aloha from The Familia de Hawaii. ðºð¤ð½",beach
"Our experience with Cabo Adventures couldnât have been better! Our excursion to swim with Whale sharks was incredible and we would recommend it to anyone. Our tour guide, Michele and bus driver, Alfredo couldnât have made the day any more enjoyable than they already did. Micheleâs extroverted pepiness really gave the trip life (even in the wee hours of the morning it began). Alfredoâs incredible driving got us everywhere on time and his crazy parking skills canât be outdone.The day begins at the marina, meeting your tour guide and the rest of the group. Our group overall was relatively large, so we had a larger tour bus drive us up to La Paz. The drive is pretty long, but it gives you a little time to eat a snack and learn about the whale sharks as well as the various doâs and donâts.When you arrive youâre divvyâd into groups and assigned a boat guide, ours was Joe. This is the guide responsible for the seafaring portion of your adventure. From there you get your wet suit on and head out to your boat.In the boats you head out to the whale sharks. The boat guide and boat driver do an incredible job of spotting and maneuvering around the sharks within the reserve. Once spotted and in position, a group of 3-4 of you get ready and hop into the water. From there, your boat guide promptly arranges you and you begin swimming as fast as you can. The shark will quickly catch up with you, so do swim as fast as you can! You will only be capable of swimming alongside the shark for a minute or two before youâre either outrun or lose breath. Taking cameras and extra gadgets in the water can definitely affect your swimming speed. From there youâre picked up by the boat and given a second to catch your breath as the other group jumps into the water. From there your two groups trade on and off in the water until you run out of time or canât go in any longer. Your time with the sharks is somewhat short just because of their speed, so take in every moment as much as you can!Afterwards we were served some fish tacos for lunch and made some various stops on the journey back to Cabo San Lucas.The whole trip was unbelievably amazing, driven by the incredible crew that we had. This trip was undeniably worth the price and I would definitely do it again! A full day trip, weâll worth your time!",sea
"I went on the luxury yacht tour, and had Angel as our guide, and Jesus as the captain. Well worth the money. We had an amazing snack and lunch, drinks, and a professional photographer on board. Snorkeling and paddle boarding was a lot of fun. We saw fish, sea lions, and pelicans.",sea
"I had an amazing time with this whole little trip that I did with my family. We were a little bummed at the cruise ship and didn't mention that they're renovating their pool Splash Zone water slide area, but the company made up for it and made our trip very enjoyable. I'm actually looking forward to going back when they open up the water slide area because it looks really cool, and it's huge. Everybody was very professional and knowledgeable, especially when we went on the Exotic Animal tour. My daughter was super excited to pet the bunnies and see the monkey. Me and the wife decided to ride the RZR Polaris 900 CC utv Vehicles which went very fast and after we rode those we ended up getting on the ATVs and riding them all the way down to the beach on the beach sand where one of our tour guides named mykey with a y. It was very enjoyable getting to ride the camels that they have over there because I've never done that before in my life. I would highly recommend you go and check these guys out if you're on a cruise ship or looking for an Excursion in Los cabos. Their vans that pick you up are very clean and comfortable with air conditioning which takes you to their Resort.",beach

"We did the Sunset Dinner Sailing excursion and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The sailboats in the outfitters fleet all looked newer and in top shape.  There were 16 of us onboard and we were not crowded in any way.  Seating was comfortable, food and drink was acceptable.  Our tour guides Pablo and Dany were personable and seemed well experienced.  I would definitely recommend taking a jacket along as it got chilly when the sun went down.  Blankets were provided and required.  We went with Cabo Adventures based partly on the fact that they provided transfers to and from our resort, and our concierge offered decent prices. Was a great experience and I would recommend.",sea

"Overall a poor experience we chose a Photo Whale Watching experience assuming the skipper would choose to get the boat as close as legally permitted with no other boats in the way on this he failed repeatedly, even when the whales appeared outside of the other boats close to use within 2 minutes we were at the back.The additional issue was the constant inane chatter from Karla the guide it never stopped throughout. We spent over 30 minutes of the tour getting out to open sea whilst some of this was due to harbour restrictions the vast majority was trying to show us amongst the other boats the arch and beaches which whilst pretty wasnât the point of the tour.Once at sea we did see whales but the majority of the time with the sun in our face making photographs all very prone to becoming silhouettes. No drinks were offered throughout the tour although supposedly included.To top it all off when we did have whales close by few other boats and positioned well for photos we were pulled away as we needed to listen to a hydrophone that heard nothing so a recording was played losing time with the whales we returned to the dock approx 20 mins earlier than had been suggested for the tour.","beach, sea"

"This place is extremely committed to making sure you have a a great time doing some amazing stuff. We we're fortunate enough to have had two back-to-back activities with Cabo Advwntures.The first outing was Off-Road RZR trail zipping through dry riverbeds and finding awesome nature along the way. We saw wild goats, natural spring falls, migrating whales and desolate beaches. Totally exhilirating!  The food and drinks after were a perfectly prepared  sopes feast with aguas frescas all while being on a completely empty beach.Whale Shark swimming was our second experience. Unbelievable!  Alex, our tour guide and snorkel guide and photographer and general wealth of information around the flora, fauna, ecosystem and nature-loving community in BCS, made everyone feel at ease and helped those who were fearful or skeptical of going through with the adventure.Overall, Our guides make all the difference in making things go from great to life changing.  They were extremely knowledgeable, professional, and overall friends you want around you when you want to have a safe, fun time.I would rebooked these guys to anyone.",beach
Dylan and Miguel with Cabo Adventures took great care of us during our snorkeling adventure! Dylan provided great knowledge of the local history and geography of the area and captain Miguel kept us protected on the crazy waves! We did snorkeling and some kayaking. The fish were gorgeous! Watch out for some of the small jellyfishâ¦they do sting. Our tour guides gave us some vinegar and cream for the spots where we got stung and it reduced the pain significantly. Great trip overall minus my tid bit of seasickness. We got a yummy snack at the end as well! Highly recommend!,sea
"Great snorkel & sea adventure with Rich! Water toys, fun, fast boat, and quesadillas at the end. This is a real deal!",sea
We did the Sea of Cortez tour which was amazing and a great opportunity to swim up close to the Sea Lions. Our tour guides were Raz and Alex who were excellent and very knowledgeable of the area. The boat crew were also amazing.The only issue was the the tour group was quite large and there were a fair few children who struggled with the instructions to keep their distance from the sea lions colony causing our time in the water to be cut short.On the whole an amazing day and a five star rating for an excellent and professional tour and a great day in Mexico,"sea, cortez"
"Absolutely the best zip tour I've ever done, I need a couple more stars to give!!!I was a season's pass holder for two years at an adventure park, I try to zip and climb everywhere whenever I'm on vacation, and this was a phenomenal experience.Our guides (Joel, Mago, Arturo, Erid, Evaristo, Brandon, and Carlos) were quick, efficient, safe, and super fun from start to finish.  It was like hanging out with all the cool kids, and it felt like they were genuinely enjoying their jobs and they took amazing care of us all day.The upside down and Superman zips were glorious, and I loved the additional cable element, rock climbing wall, rappelling, and light bouldering that really made this tour stand out.The lunch was lovely, it's a gorgeous location, and they have a wonderful staff all the way across the board.  This is the only place where I've ever bought the photo package - the photographer was very professional and amazing at getting fantastic action shots and posed snaps for the memories.  No regrets!Thank you so much for an awesome day!!  When the shuttle came, I really just wanted to go back to the starting line and do it all again!",sea

Two hours were up and will appeared 20-foot off the bow to the starboard side, it approached the boat went under it and appeared on the other side.

My wife and I decided to book the Luxury Sailing, Snorkeling and Lunch Cruise during our October honeymoon vacation to Cabo. Our tour guides were professional, friendly and knowledgable. Their English was GREAT if that's something you're worried about! (Doesn't matter to me as both my wife and I are bilingual, and also realize we are in *their* country lol.) Not to mention, the guides were very funny and entertaining and helpful!There was an incident worth mentioning... My wife got extremely sea sick on the boat. Franco and Caesar made her a drink that helped, were extremely kind and very accommodating. Unfortunately she ended up throwing up, on the deck of the sailboat no less. They immediately cleaned the mess up and helped clean her up too. They were very understanding and sweet about the whole situation.

"Listen up! This is NOT luxury sailing.The food was very cheap  and  the liquor was not premium as advertised. If I would have known it would be so bad, I would have brought my own food and liquor. We could not even eat the lunch, I we just ate the fruits. The shrimp appetizers were  not bad.I also thought we were going to dock at a beach and be free to do other activities  other than paddle boat and snorkeling, like kayaking or rent jet skis. You are stuck on the boat for 4 hours with cheap liquor, no bottled water or canned drinks and bad lunch. But the scenery is beautiful, thank goodness!As for the boat, it was actually comfortable but please know it is not covered at all. The only covered part is where the sailor is seating, the part with the blue tent.Absolutely a waste of 4 hours and $700 for my family of 5.","beach, sea"

Very reputable company in Cabo.  The snorkel excursion out on the luxury boat included a continental breakfast along with a lunch.  The bartender served us in the seating area at the top of the boat and provided great service.  The whole crew was fabulous.,sea
"The most established and well-organised company in terms of trips in Cabo San Lucas from our experience. The 2 bay snorkel was a fantastic and memorable experience. We did not think we would get into the water to snorkel as we are not confident swimmers. But with the buoyancy aid around your waist, you just float. Lots of fish to see. The catamaran was a better choice to go out into the sea- options to lie in front, sitting area aft and another area on top around the captain. The crew ( guide, photographer and chef) were amazing. Open bar for a drink - we enjoyed one on the way back! An unforgettable experience. Do not hesitate, just book!",sea

"We took a tour to the island of Espiritu Santo, which was wonderful. They picked us up from San Jose del Cabo and from the San Lucas dolphinarium. We all left together for La Paz (it's about a 2-hour drive), I recommend having breakfast before going because there are a lunch until 11:00 or so when you arrive at the catamaran they give you fruit, yogurt, bread and juice, the road is slow so you can enjoy the scenery and drinks. They go directly to the island of the sea lions where you swim for about 30 minutes with them, it's a very cool experience because they pass close to you and you can almost touch them. If you don't know how to swim very well, there are some guys who help my parents. the whole process (thank you), you can only swim with them in a certain season of the year, it seems to me that from September to February but I'm not sure, after that they give you the food which is very tasty, they are sandwiches, pasta and guacamole if they are good quantities, after lunch we stopped at another spot where we could swim and we spent a while there and then we returned to the port, I don't know if it was because of the time we went where the water was very cold that we spent more time in the tacamaran than in the water, for which I think it is a very good option if you want to do something relaxing, it is not tiring so older people can go the catamaran always goes at a very adequate speed, in general everything was more than perfect the attention was always appropriate, it is highly recommended to take this tour with them.",sea

"I would love to say that I had and amazing time on this tour but I didnât. I booked this excursion as a birthday surprise for my friend during our stay in Los Cabos. All in all it was beautiful in the beginning. The group was dry and boring so we tried talking and making jokes with the instructor with hopes of loosening everyone up, that barely worked. The drinks and the light snack with lunch was cool. We docked near a beach and my friend and I relaxed aboard while everyone else swam, snorkeled, or did the paddle boarding activity. As we are on our way back, the instructor âsurprisesâ us and says hey now weâre going sailing. Iâve never experienced sailing so I didnât know what to expect but I would have said no had they explained or prepared us for what was next.Soon enough the boat began to tilt HEAVILY. My friend and I are literally sliding off the side of the boat. I was honestly so scared to fall in. I had on a dress and it was super slippery. No railing on the side of the boat just us and the water. No life vests were provided. The couple in front of us knew what was coming so they moved all the way to the back before this activity began. Not one of the instructors warned us or mentioned to us to sit in the back if we were uncomfortable with the activity. Next thing you know the captain hits a gigantic wave and my friend and I are all soaking wet. At this point I honestly felt myself about to slide off the boat and into the water. I had on light make up, contacts so I could wear my sunglasses, and also had an eyelash set done before coming. I was extremely upset to have gotten splashed in my face like this with sea salt.A woman on the other side told the tour guide she could clearly see we were not enjoying this and maybe they should stop. The captain proceeded to continue sailing. It was overall a horrible experience.For everyone on the boat to have gotten in the water and we didnât, you would think ""hey maybe they didnât plan on getting wet today."" I feel it was horribly thought through. I would never in my life board a boat again, I am extremely traumatized.","beach, sea"
"We took two tours with Cabo Adventures in August of 2022. I wanna share both because I feel like they were a different experience.The luxury snorkeling tour was a bit of a miss for us. Was super excited to go on a sailboat for the first time, but they had the sails up for like 5 minutes only for photos. If I had known that I probably would have booked us the two bay catamaran because at least itâs more time snorkeling. Also, when we got there it was a free for all. The crew just gave us gear and thatâs it. No information on where to go to snorkel or a guide on the water. It seemed like it was ALLL about the photos. Listen, I get they have a job to do. But not everyone has $100 for a photo when I could take it on my phone. If I want one Iâll ask, but at the arch I asked someone to take a photo for us and the photographer said she needs the spot to take photos. Just pretty rude we already spend a lot for the tour I just wanted to take a photo for probably 10 seconds.The second tour we did, Sea of Cortez in La Paz was AMAZING. The crew (led the Diego who was incredible) made the day so fun. Breakfast and lunch were honestly a good portion, kept drinks flowing after the snorkel and really cared about us and the experience. They guided us into the reef and helped find octopus and other amazing marine life. They showed everyone how to use the gear and really went above and beyond to make everyone comfortable and have fun. This is the one Iâd say do not miss! Also they were as aggressive about us using our own phones and GoPro for photos or pressuring about buying them.All in all, the company was professional and has some great excursions I just wouldnât say the luxury snorkel is worth it in my opinion, unless it was the crew we had.","sea, cortez"
Sea Bass was great!  We had a great time and the snacks were great!,sea
"We did 2 excursions with Cabo Adventures during our time there. The first was the snorkeling trip with Richie and the second was the sunset cruise with Jesus and Edgar. If you donât like rough waters, we would caution you to go.The snorkeling trip was so much fun! We took a speedboat and Richie was sure to point out all of the sights and get photos of us. The snorkeling spot he took us to was breathtaking. The water is so clear and there are so many different colorful fish! He pointed out the different kinds, and he let us free dive when we had some time left. With the speed of the boat and the rough waters in Cabo, it was definitely choppy. Overall, Richie and the snorkeling trip were a lot of fun.The sunset cruise was also very nice and relaxing. Even on the sailboat though, the choppy waters were enough to cause the boat to move around a lot - if you get seasick easily we donât recommend it. Jesus and Edgar were funny and personable and they were sure to take lots of pictures of us. The food they serve on the trip isnât the best, but the drinks are great! The photos they take on their cameras are very expensive to buy, we recommend having someone take photos of you on your personal camera. It was a beautiful trip though!Our only complaint with Cabo Adventures is that all of the excursions are run out of the same place, and they donât really give you much information when you get there. They required us to get there an hour before our time slot in case of lines from people with other excursions. We got back from our snorkeling trip at 3:10pm to find out that the next shuttle bus didnât leave until 4pm. It definitely took up the whole day which was a bit of a bummer. We only chose them as they worked with our hotel and our hotel ran a promo to get the excursions at 25% the cost, otherwise we probably would have looked into other one off places.",sea
It was just OK. It was like a petting zoo. Not too adventurous. Camel rides only 20 mins and In a circle in the beach. Best part of the trip was the tequila tasting.,beach
"Very well organized, professional tour company in Cabo. Our tour guide Tomas as friendly and attentive. We loved seeing all the sights in Cabo and spending time on the boat. I think it I could go again I would perhaps not do the snorkel sail cruise. Loved the day, but there is not much to see when snorkeling. Also, be aware that you actually do sail on the sailing part of the cruise! We didnât think that one through and got a bit seasick lol. But thatâs on us! The sailing was cool. Loved the easy pick up & drop off as well.",sea
"We were pleasantly surprised to see multiple whales, dolphins and a giant sea turtle.",sea
"We had a fabulous half day snorkeling tour with Jacob, Ana, Jose and Joel. The crew will treat you like royalty! The we even saw whales along the way as well as a sea turtle. The whole process was seemless from picking up at my hotel to delivering me back safely. I highly recommend this company.",sea
"The instructor was informative and funny at the same time. My boyfriend and I are not licensed PADI divers so the practice in the pool was helpful as there was a lot of info to process. We paired up with a partner but at one point I began panicking and wanted to quit. Jorge pointed to his head letting me know I was overthinking things. He grabbed my hand and was pointing at the different fish, moray eels, the sea anemones that bloomed when he snapped. Soon my breathing calmed down as I was distracted by the beauty under water. If it wasnât for Jorge, I would have missed out on the full experience. This was so awesome!!",sea
Great experience riding ?? on the beach and driving atv threw the desert,beach
"Husband & I took the snorkel trip on a nice sunny day that started out with mimosas and anything else you desired to drink.  20 minutes later we enjoyed a delightful snack of shrimp, guacamole, salsa picante & chips.  We were taken to Santa Maria Beach for snorkeling and the others could play around in the  water with the paddle board for about half an hour.  While we were anchored we were served a full delicious lunch of 5 different items on our own platters.  They then took us further out to set the sails and watch for whales.  The whales did not disappoint!  The captain slowed us down so we could keep pace.  Mannie and Carmien were our guides who were knowledgeable and fun.  We highly recommend these 2 gentlemen on a job well done.","beach, santa maria"
Luxury tour in winter season you can see the whales,sea
"We went on the Luxury Sailing tour and I cannot express how much fun we had with Erick and Charly!  It was honestly the highlight of the trip.  The tour included snacks, open bar, lunch, paddle boarding, and snorkeling.  We loved having a photographer on board as well to capture all of the moments that we would not have thought to snap a picture of at the time.The pick-up from the hotel was seamless and the check in was fast and easy.  It was seriously such a great time that we considered signing up for another tour if there wasn't forecast for bad weather in the upcoming days.I can't recommend this enough! I will be telling everyone who is traveling to Cabo to take this tour!!",sea

"Please read before you book ANYTHING with Cabo adventures.TLDR:  there are so many additional hidden fees that you end up paying so much more than the original paid ticket - Overall, I paid $175 (vs $104 listed ticket price online) for the âcomboâ ticket of eco farm, ATV and camel ride and it was absolutely NOT worth it. The company really tries to squeeze as much money out of the customer - to describe each step in more detail:1) Initial booking - price and additional hidden feesI saw the combo ticket online for $104 (at an advertised 30% discount). When I went to check out the total price ended up being about $120 with additional fees, taxes, etc. After I booked the ticket, I see in the email an additional $20 is required for âpark entrance feesâ. Iâm thinking that this must be a huge park where you can roam around if theyâre requiring another fee on top of the price of the ticket. This was not the case - the entrance fee does NOT get you anything else,  it really is just another way to get additional dollars after the initial payment. I get to the location and was told that I had to pay an additional $35 per person (if we each wanted our own vehicle to ride) for âATV insurance.â I thought this was a payment we would get back as long as there were no damages to the vehicle but thats not the case - itâs really just another way to get more money. These types of things should already be built into the initial price! So for each person, it was an additional $55 on top of the $120 I paid online which brings the grand total to $175 per person (vs the initial $104 sticker price - 70% higher!). Maybe I wouldnât have minded too much about the price if the excursion was actually worth it! Surprise surprise - itâs not.2) 1st activity - EcofarmThis is an absolute joke of an excursion. This is literally a 20 minute tour of their âecofarmâ which goes through how to make paper out of camel poop and how to make chocolate. No - we did not get to do any of that process or even see it in action- the tour guide literally spoke so fast and it was not interactive at all. Only pro - you get a small piece of chocolate at the end3) 2nd activity - camel ridingThis was a laughable excursion as well. I thought weâd be riding camels through various sceneries - no we literally got on the camels, walked along the beach, circled back and then dismounted. Whole riding time was 15 minute, 20 minutes MAX. What did we do after ? For the next 20 min, we sat in a gazebo area where we were told some random camel facts and took turns having the photographer take pictures of us with a camel and of course they didnât allow us to use our own cameras because they want to charge you later for the photos. More details on aggregious upsells later.3) 3rd activity - ATVThis was the most âworthâ activity. We spent about 30-40 minutes on the ATV and I enjoyed this activity (but definitely not $175 / person worth)4) They are constantly trying to sell you thingsAfter the ATV, a little less than 3 hours have passed. For the final hour, you were brought to the dining and photo area. You also werenât allowed to leave early unless you drove there yourself. So for an hour - they would sell you on photos (starting at $150 - $250 for a photo package) and on expensive food and alcohol. After about 45 minutes of waiting around in this dining area, we did the tequila tasting - you get to try 3 different types of tequila which I did enjoy.Overall, it was definitely not worth the money. Where does all the money go? It goes towards marketing - Cabo adventures advertisements are plastered everywhere in Cabo -  from my hotel lobby, to grocery stores, to multiple stands in the touristy areas.Word to the wise - these types of excursions are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper if you negotiate with the tourist vendors at the beach / near the touristy areas. With the $175, I could have probably gotten 3-4 really solid excursions. I know for next time to definitely not go with Cabo adventures and just wait till I land to book these excursions.",beach
"Excellent staff. We saw more humpback whales on our beach / catamaran tour than we did in Alaska. We did pay for photos from the trip, only to find out back on the cruise ship that we got another couple's photos. Still trying to work out. Hopefully lol.",beach
"Me and two friends did the scuba and sea adventure. The staff were exceptional. Diego, Lucas and Roberto were great and knowledgable and went out of their way to find humpback whales! The only thing that would have made it better  is if pictutes were included like some tours do. They were attentive to making my friends comfortable since this was their first time snorkeling. Would recommend.",sea

"Fantastic experience with Cabo Adventures on the Sea & Snorkel Tour. Richard was an excellent guide taking us to see Lover's Beach, Pelican Rock, a sea lion colony, the famous arch, and Land's End. Then we got to snorkel, kayak, and paddle board. Would highly recommend!","beach, sea, land's end"
It is a wonderful impressive experience the camels and the view of the sea if you can go do it the cost was 1340 while staying at the treasure a question of looking for prices the tour is short but it is worth the cost of the photos is 480 each,sea
We had a great experience and fun on the Sea of Cortez wildlife and snorkling adventure.  I would definitely recommend this trip. The food and staff were outstanding! We were up blose to sea lions and so many fish.,"sea, cortez"
"Our experience with them was great. We chose to go on the luxury sailing tour. We went on a 4-Hour tour down the Cabo coast. We ended up at a beautiful cove where we snorkeled and paddle boarded. Then we went further out to sea experiencing some open ocean. We got a wonderful snack and a wonderful lunch including alcoholic beverages.  Erick, Charlie, and Lily were all wonderful. Highly recommended",sea

"My boyfriend and I did the snorkeling in Cabo Pulmo and it was an adventure. We had a 2 hour drive from Cabo San Lucas which was in a clean and cool sprinter van. When snorkeling the guide led us to 4 different spots and we were able to see various fishes even sea turtle and manta ray! Boat ride was rocky and I did get seasick but my boyfriend was able to manage, just as a heads up for those who are first timers! Even people in our group who are well experienced in snorkeling before were getting queasy. But overall, Cabo adventures provided what was promised in description and we had a great time. Thank you to our driver Gabriel and the Tornado Dive Center for the experience!",sea
"Luis, Pepe and Gil were great and very passionate about guiding us through both the desert and beach ebike ride. This was my wife and I's first time on an ebike, neither one of us felt unsafe or unprepared prior to hitting the trails with ample instruction given and riding practice.. We got to see dolphins and whales surfacing right off the beach, that was pretty amazing. Our ride ended with making our own margs and enjoying them with some Mexican cuisine made on their campus. When we come back to visit we will book another #CaboAdventure, we felt very safe with them, they were a class act. We also learned a little about how to make chocolate from the Mexican cocoa bean.",beach
"My partner and I participated in the Sunset Sailing. The scenery and vibes were amazing, however in the first 30 minutes we both got sea sick and threw up the remainder of the ride. The tides were very strong and it was not a pleasant experience. The staff was truly amazing. They gave us both water, and ice chips to help with the sickness. We wish we could have really enjoyed the experience more but our bodies did not like the sea. Never again lol.P.S. I would recommend eating hours before and not the food the provided. It wasnât tasty and it probably added to our sea sickness.",sea
"Whale watching was superb. A very nice boat with good seating and a quality lunch with seconds if you like , with plenty to drink. Very friendly staff and service. They will offer quality photos at a fair price.",sea
"I did the whale shark swim with this company.  I had a great time, our tour guide did a great job.  I can't remember his name, but he's tall with short hair and into rock climbing.  I feel like this guide truly cared about the conservation of the whale sharks and was very informative about the species.  Sometimes people claim they care about the conservation but don't really SHOW IT.  This guy showed it, he was passionate about the safety of the animal.  When I originally scheduled I scheduled for Feb, 14.  My plans ended up changing due to a cancelation from an unrelated scuba diving shop, and I walked down to the Cabo Adventures building in the Marina and they were happy to rearrange my date to Feb 15, in order to accommodate my scuba diving with the other company.  They didn't try to charge me extra or give any hassle.  They just said ""Let me see if I have a spot open.  Yes, I do."" and I was changed over and good to go.  I appreciate the ease with that.  I had signed up for hotel transport, but I was staying in the Marina so they said to walk down to the shop instead (like a 4 minute walk) which was fair.  The location of the shop is convenient if you are staying around the Marina.  It's also nice and clean inside.  So I waited for 15 minutes until the group and guide were all there and we boarded a shuttle to La Paz.  They gave us a bagged sandwich, chips, and some juice for the ride.  I didn't expect that and it was nice.  The lunch that was provided at the restruant was also good.  It was a cute little restruant and we sat at tables in the sand of the little beach.  I enjoyed the food.  We did see one whale shark and were able to swim with it 5-6 times.  They took a video with a go pro, but the water was really murky ( that's all dependent on mother nature).  They offer to sell you the video and some pictures at the end but it is WAY overpriced.  $50 for some go pro clips where you could barely see the shark!  They offer to put it on a zip drive and the zip drive is pretty much the cheapest quality zip drive on the existence of the earth.  It looks like the overhead on that is probably around $2.50.  You guys need to be more reasonable on the videos and pics and not try to start out with some ungodly high price for it- (marketing trick).  Anyhow, I really enjoyed the excursion.   I saw the beautiful giant of the sea very close up.  I had a great lunch.  All in all it was a fantastic day that will be in my memories forever!","beach, sea"
"Whale watching trip was fun and very educational. Saw a ton of wildlife including sea turtles, marlin, dolphins, sea lions, and of course whales. Unfortunately my picture taking stinks when it comes to capturing breaching whales.",sea
"Our family did the Snorkeling and Sea Adventure. It was fantastic. Our guides Pancho, Carlos, and Ray and the equipment guys were all awesome. They are punctual and safe. They have lockers, but it is easier to just bring a water tight bag and pack light. Everything is provided. While you're Snorkeling, kayaking, and paddle boarding your stuff will be safe in the boat. We saw whales close up on the ride out and all sorts of sea creatures on the reef while Snorkeling. It was like swimming in an exotic aquarium but with waves. Great all the way around and purchasing through Costco made it a great deal.",sea
"Do NOT book with this company. If I could give them 0 stars I would. They ruined our honeymoon! We booked at the resort with one of their representatives. We wanted to book two excursions but she convinced us to do this deal that was 3 for the price of two. We were not really interested in anything else but picked one just because it was free. Well we only got to attend 1 of the 3 and tried to get a refund before the 48hr cut off. They did not refund us, they still continue to give us the run around even if its been months. We lots close to 1000$ CAD. Happy Honeymoon to us.

Also the only one we attended was  the Cabo snorkel and lands end arch, it was terrible. They advertise it as on lovers beach but its no where near that. Its also so deep where they off load you that you dont see barely any fish! It was horrible experience.

I highly recommend Wild Canyon instead. We did a day with them and wish we wouldnt of pre-booked with Cabo adventures as they were more organized and everything was near by. No wasted travel time!","beach, lovers"

"Cabo Adventures Off Road (Polaris Side by Side) with Damien and Noriega as the main guides. Took about 15 minutes to get from hotel to the Cabo Adventure main location, then 1hr bus ride to Tierra Sagrada. Started with about a 1hr tour of the Eco Farm (ate chocolate made there, pictures with goats and Parrots that were very well trained). Then a 2hr drive on the Polaris RZR with a chance to switch seats at the halfway point. We had a mechanical issue that the crew was very quick to swap us in to a spare RZR. The end of the ride was at the Eco Farm, with cheese or cheese and chicken Quesadilla, free Pacifica beer, and ended with a few shots of different tequila. Then a 1hr bus ride to Cabo San Lucas and then shuttles to your hotel. The staff were great, and the family enjoyed it (some of us more than others). I would recommend this to anyone who wants to spend a day on an adventure. About 8hrs from door to door.",sea
"We were extremely disappointed with the Outback and Camel Safari and feel we wasted our day attending. It was NOTHING like the description in the catalog provided to us - âLive an amazing eco-adventure in the countryside of Baja California. Take a nature walk then board an open-all, 4x4 military-style Unimog to continue deeper into the rugged Baja outback. View ancient cacti that live in the sandy pathways, and keep an eye out for chipmunks, foxes, deer and 'caracara"" falcons who live and hide in the desert. Next, ride a camel along the beach at Rancho San Cristobal, enjoying breathtaking views of the ocean.â The catalog also stated to bring âSwimsuit and towel for the cenoteâ.We were picked up from our hotel at our scheduled time for the hour long drive to the park. They promptly checked us in as soon as we arrived and told us our tour was scheduled to start in 30 minutes. A while later one of the guides came out and mentioned that a group from another hotel was running late. They proceeded to take us through presentations about plastic recycling, donkeys, goats, and finally cocoa beans. Once these presentations were completed, we waited about 10 minutes before another set of guides came out to split everyone in 2 groups. From this point on, cameras and cell phones were forbidden. They walked us to some benches to educate us about camels and wait for everyone in our group (about 17 people) to take several group and individual pictures with a camel. A few people complained to our guide Bill about the amount of time wasted up to this point. After a brief safety briefing and helmet fitting, we mounted the camels and walked up and down the beach for about 20 minutes. They fed us lunch outdoors (with no shortage of flies) and gave us a few shots of tequila before loading us on the back of a truck to take us to the exit. When our driver picked us up to return us to the hotel, we asked about stopping at the cenote. He said that portion of the trip was canceled due to rain making it too muddy. Turns out there are no cenotes in Los Cabos! Based on the catalog, this was supposed to be a 4 hour trip plus transportation. The van ride was an hour each way. Our 6 hour trip, turned into 8 hours with only about 20 minutes of it actually riding a camel.",beach
"Booked the sunset cruise to see the arches with my friend. We are in our late 20s. Hotel pickup/drop off was as expected. Signs urging for tips in the bus was tacky.  Arriving at the Cabo adventures building was a bit chaotic, so I'm glad our driver told us where to go as there were many people and tours gathering. We then took a very sunny, 5 min walk to the boat. It was about a 40 foot sailboat and the best views were on the front of the boat. I'm 5""9 160 lbs and found the seating to be cramped for over a two hour trip. I had a tiny slice of cushion to myself and my butt was numb after about 15 min. No back support, felt like I had less of a personal bubble than on an airplane. My friend had a lady keep bumping shoulders with her and I could barely stretch out my legs and relax without having to move them to let the tour guide walk by. The worst part, and a big part of my low rating, is the fact that there is this obnoxious photographer on board taking photos throughout the trip. It felt forced and was quite intrusive to have to keep smiling at this random lady so she could take photos we weren't the least bit interested in buying. It felt like I was the bride at a wedding there were so many photos taken. After the first 45 minutes or so she got the hint and stopped forcing us to pose. The food was not great. Guac with store bought chips, tasteless pasta salad, salad with a couple grape tomatoes, and bread.  Lettuce kept flying off my plate. And trying to drink on the boat was a joke, kept spilling on myself and I hadn't had any alcohol before the boat. They gave everyone a welcome mimosa and then took drink orders. The wine left lots to be desired. Music on the boat was too loud and the same songs were on repeat. I heard one song three times! Overall, despite the great views the atmosphere wasn't what I was hoping for. I wanted to sit back, relax and chat with my friend. But it was too loud, cramped, and felt like I had paparazzi around me.",sea
"The Luxury Sunset Sail made for a terrific day with my dad. Danny, Ben and photographer Fernanda were an outstanding and caring crew. The tour company took obvious efforts to ensure that the boat was well sanitized and that the passengers abided by safety precautions.We loved the food (exceptional ceviche, shrimp & guacamole among other great items), the drinks (wide selection, plentiful, and excellently made), the sailing (the boat was high quality, and picked up impressive speed while feeling safe & secure), as well as the time spent snorkeling (beautiful fish, and even a Tortuga). We appreciated the photo opportunity next to the Cabo Arch / Lover's Beach.All-in-all, this made for a wonderful, memorable day that was well worth the value. Thank you, Cabo Adventures!",beach
"Went scuba diving with Angel. Did a two tank dive at Land's end and pelican rock. Angel was a total professional,  and offered great service. The dives were great,  with natural underwater sand falls and rock formations as well as plenty of life and a small wreck. But the best part was how easy and professional the set up was. Equipment was new and well maintained. Angel is also an instructor and I can't imagine a calmer, more professional person to learn from. Highly recommended.",land's end
"Went FIRST time for scuba diving. The instructors were great! Equipment was good. Unfortunately I couldn't do the dive.... I was able to go down all the way to the shallow bottom sea floor but while learning how to clear water from my mask there, I did something silly and filled half my mask with water. I kind of panicked and gestured to go up. I tried twice more but unfortunately couldn't do it.....and finally gave up. Hopefully on one of my next trips, I will be able to dive successfully!",sea

"Booked 3 adventures with Cabo Adventures. Bought two adventures got the third for free!

The afternoon sailing trip was perfect.
The boat had plenty of space, the tour guides and service were great. It was a perfect blend of relaxation and excitement. The boat was in great condition and the option to paddle board or snorkel is a nice touch. They provide a  good light lunch and plenty of drinks.

Important note, make sure you understand the shuttle times. The shuttle back to hotels is every two hours starting at noon. We missed our shuttle so had to wait almost two hours for the next one. Good thing is you can check out the marina plaza while waiting for the next shuttle. Their facilities are located on the marina plaza.

Leo is an awesome tour guide.

Dolphin swim was awesome!!! Better than expected and worth every cent.. My wife and I had a great time. The staff were great, facilities are awesome and the dolphins swim was a true life experience.. Weve swam with Dolphins before on other vacations and this was the best by far... highly recommended :)

Note: the pictures are a little pricey, so be prepared if you want them!

Off road Polaris side by side excursion.
It was awesome. They took us to an off road trail in the desert and along Baja race trails. The machines are awesome, 900cc, new 2017 units. The trail was up and down mountain sides, through a river, got totally wet and along a beach on the ocean. Lots of turns and different terrain. Got to open them up as well.
Ive done theses excursions in Cancun but this was the best by far!!! Guides are awesome.
I totally recommend it, suggest bringing a change of clothes though fir the trip back.
Travel to and from about 45 mins.. provided a good lunch on the beach too.

Thank you Cabo Adventures, it was a great time!!!!
