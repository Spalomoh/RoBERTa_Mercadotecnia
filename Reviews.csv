1,6 days ago,My son and I had an amazing time. Great memories that will last a lifetime. I cannot say enough about this company and how friendly and fun they were on our ATV excursion.   The food was great the drinks were better.  Sitting by the fire afterwards was a nice bonus. This is a must do activity while in Cabo.,a week ago,"Thank you for your amazing review and comments, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.We can't wait to see you again and create more fun memories!",5
2,4 weeks ago,"Sailing trip around the point in Cabo.  Sail boat was a lot of fun and the crew was extremely accommodating.The day was crazy windy, so we didn‚Äôt do much actual sailing.  Food was decent, the guacamole was top notch and all the drinks you could handle.We sailed out for an hour to a cove that was calm and did snorkeling and paddle boarding.",,,4
3,a month ago,We had the most amazing experience on the luxury sailing excursion. The crew made sure we had the best time and kept us safe and happy throughout the whole trip. The drinks were plentiful and food and snacks were perfect for a trip on the sea. The boat was beautiful and clean. The whole experience was top notch from pick up to drop off we didn‚Äôt have to worry about a thing. We will only book excursions from them for all our future trips to Cabo and was honestly the highlight of our vacation. I highly recommend them and this particular excursion.,,,5
4,5 days ago,"I had no idea The Arc was 1/4 mile away from the marina. So, I wasn‚Äôt just expecting to go by in and in a big circle. Fairly boring. The crew member named Benjamin on our boat was rude. When I got on the boat I had an empty can of Diet Coke I purchased in the lobby. I asked him if he could throw it away for me when I climbed on the boat. He was reluctant and made a sassy comment about me asking where the trash was and handing it to him. Then, he was irritated when we declined the mimosas because we don‚Äôt drink alcohol. When he asked us later if we wanted a drink we asked for water or something without alcohol. But he said they didn‚Äôt have anything. So we went 2 hours without a beverage. He was also seemingly intoxicated and checking out the young women in a creepy and inappropriate way. The young lady photographer and the captain seemed great. But this one guy totally diminished the experience for us. I didn‚Äôt know I had to get drunk and be drinking to enjoy a sail boat at sunset? Also it is a bit too long. We didn‚Äôt need to be on the boat for 2 hours. Not that much to see after The Arc.",,,2
5,2 months ago,"This was such a great experience! So much fun, sun, thrill, excitement and adventure!

6,a week ago,Not what I expected!  Sunset sail was on a sailboat but no sailing. Drove around for thirty minutes after sunset which was weird! Crew was trying to be nice but were clearly tired!Was told to be ready for a 3:45 pickup at 3:30 actual time 4:00 arrived at the pier at 4:30 left to go to boat at 5:25 two hours of waiting seemed good for them not so good for us.Food and drinks were bad.The positives beautiful sunset and we were on the water.,,,2
7,a month ago,"The sunset cruise is amazing! Gorgeous views of the ocean, the rocks, and the arch and there are tons of stingrays to see. Tomas, our guide, was very warm and welcoming and had a great sense of humor. I highly recommend this activity. A little word of adviceÖ try to be one of the first to board the boat so you can get a seat right up front. We were able to stretch out and lay down which the made the experience much more romantic and relaxing!",,,5

We enjoyed our day so much! We were impressed by the boat ans the day. The crew was top notch: warm, kind and fun. Food and drinks were available all day. We snorkeled and toured around the islands.

12,4 months ago,"What a great experience! Our guides did everything they could to get us to places where the whales were active, we got lots of great pictures and videos. We were able to get close due to the small speed boat that held 18 people. There was a photographer on board who captured additional shots we could buy at the end if we didn‚Äôt get good ones ourselves. We all wore life jackets but felt safe the whole time! Had a blast!!",,,5
13,3 months ago,"Very fun snorkeling/water sports experience and well priced. Harbor and run out to the arch was beautiful and snorkeling/kayaking/sea scooter were all great. Captain and guide were super accommodating and fun.Went in Feb so the ocean was a little cold. We opted to not wear wetsuits which was fine for me but if you get cold easily, you may want one. Upside is that it was whale season, so we saw humpbacks jumping.They fed us at the end which was an appreciated surprise. Overall very worth it!",,,5

The staff are beyond kind and helpful. The camels were so sweet and a pure joy to ride. The views of the Pacific are gorgeous. The food was literally the best I ate during my stay in Cabo. The tequila was a great bonus as well. But the best part of the adventure was our guide David. His knowledge was on point and his laughter infectious. By the end of our time together it felt like we were all a group of old friends. Do not hesitate to book with them. I look forward to coming back in the future.",,,5
17,4 months ago,We had a fun whale watching boat trip with acabo Expeditions. The guide and boat captain were excellent. The guide hosted the tour in Spanish and English. We have 2 other trips scheduled with them for later this week. This company is extremely well organized and professional! They have a coffee shop and gift shop inside their building. My only complaint is that they charge $20 per photo for photos their photographer took on the trip. None of them were worth $20 but itís an optional charge.,4 months ago,"We are glad you liked it and look forward to welcoming you on a future adventure, during your next visit to Los Cabos.",5

We stopped at Santa Maria Beach to snorkel, paddle board, and relax & leisure. I saw the biggest school of fish in my life at Santa Maria and there must've been 50k fish swarming together. Our crew members Jaros, Cpt. Pablo, Hillary, and Andy were great. They made sure everyone had a great time, they fed us well, and they made amazing drinks for us. We didn't get to sail cause of low winds, but they made up by tracking down some whales nearby so we could whale watch.",2 months ago,"Thank you for having taken the time to post your wonderful review of Cabo Adventures and sharing how much you enjoyed our Luxury Day Sailing adventure.

30,2 months ago,"I did 2 separate tours. The first one, the Luxery Sunset Sail was perfect. The crew was fun and the boat was full but didn't feel crowded. They had a great photographer that captured tons of pics and it was worth the money to buy the extra pics. The sback tray was perfect for an evening boat ride and the drinks were plentiful.

The whale watching was ok. Unfortunately we only saw a few whales off in the distance and it seemed like we were constantly trying to chase them down only to miss them. The raft was pretty crowded and not near as comfortable.  The pictures were not worth buying because it was too crowded for them to take many individual pics and there were not enough whale sightings either.",,,5

Everyone here was so friendly, helpful, and pleasant.Be advised that the photos are an additional cost. I bought the cheapest package and paid $85 for digital copies that were uploaded to my phone via USB-c immediately after paying, however families had to pay more (since they had more photos/individuals).

We did the camel/ATV/lunch and tequila tasting on one day, and the snorkel and the arch viewing (he even took us whale watching for a few minutes, this wasn't on the tour).Con: The only drawback was that the photo packages to purchase were over priced and you're not really allowed to use your phone on the excursions. I'd encourage them to add a few packages under $100 for a few photos.Otherwise I'd be 100% book with them again.

The guides are a little overbearing, and talk to you like you are on a grade-school field trip, but they are sincere. The music was loud, and too pop-py for me, and the spring-breaker girls on board sang every song, word for word...when they weren't taking sefie after selfie. But the music got better as the trip went on, even heard some Floyd. Food is marginal, but something, anyway. Beautiful views, saw some whales, too.

61,6 months ago,"This is an adventure that everyone visiting Cabo San Lucas should experience. And I do mean experience, because this is more than just a tour, it‚Äôs an experience. The reservations with the booking agent at the resort we‚Äôre staying were easy and quick. The transportation to and from the resort was friendly and hassle-free.  The food and drinks (virtually unlimited) were fresh, cold, and most enjoyable. The boat crew who attended to us did so with outstanding service. Seeing whales and dolphins in the water were not part of our expectations, but when the crew spotted several humpback whales in the water, they slowed down so everyone could experience the thrill of seeing the whales jump out of the water. That was quite an experience. When we arrived at the cove to snorkel, the crew very clearly explained to everyone how to do it and individually helped those folks who had a bit of hesitation. Great service there. On the return trip to the marina the crew raised raised the sails on the boat for a 20 minute sail. There wasn‚Äôt much wind, but it was still cool to be sailing in Sea of Cortez. Overall a great experience. Thank you crew and staff.",6 months ago,"Thank you for your amazing review and comments, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.We can't wait to see you again and create more fun memories!Hasta Pronto!",5

65,2 months ago,"They made us wait a full hour before boarding the boat and the driver who took us there made annoying comments. The sailing itself was super fun, we had good food and drinks, swam in the beautiful ocean and enjoyed most of it. Juan, the captain, is truly professional, kind and funny. Also Lynnette, the photographer, was so enthusiastic and made a great effort, she‚Äôs charismatic with good conversation. Sadly, our guide Benjam√≠n behaved rudely, even  treating elderly guests with arrogance and dismissing their questions. He doesn‚Äôt have a proper use of language and didn‚Äôt give us any useful/interesting information other than rules on the boat. Besides that, Cabo Adventures shouldn‚Äôt be making profit from animal exploitation (swimming and taking pictures with captive dolphins), that‚Äôs just disgusting.",,,3

We felt very safe as we explored various sandy paths with winding and twisty spots. One of us was more adventurous and was guided to attempt more but we all rode at our own comfort level. The scenery is gorgeous and the photos taken by the photographer who always found the right spot to catch us in action were definitely ‚Äômust haves‚Äô. We highly recommend this adventure and hope you get a guide as friendly and expert as Isaac.",,,5
70,5 months ago,"Had a great time on the snorkeling excursion with Mike, Nacho and Mike! Both Mikes, had some really cool information to share with us, showed us an awesome reef and really made sure everyone had a fun time. Once we arrived at the snorkel site we eventually got options for kayaks or underwater scooters (Honestly I didn't know this was included) but it just added to the fun. If you have a GoPro definitely bring it, you'll get some great pictures and videos. We also brought our own scuba mask (because we had a full face one) but if you don't have one they obviously provide everything and the gear is very clean and good quality. Make sure to bring or purchase reef safe sunscreen beforehand and apply the sun is no joke in Cabo.",,,5

There were various activities along the way like a pendulum swing, rappel and a suspension bridge with a rock or ladder climb up about 40 feet.

Amazing views land and sea, most times depending the time of the year while on board of the Catamaran you are going to be able enjoy the views and see different birds, dolphins, whales, and if lucky while snorkelling you might be able to see other sea creatures. When not in mating season you are able to snorkel with leones/lobos marinos (sea lions) @ a short distance from Isla Esp√≠ritu Santo.

118,5 months ago,"We loved our combo Arch tour and camel riding! Karla was our guide on the boat and was funny and so kind! A gentle soul. For the camel portion, we were with Isha was so amazing. A former teacher, she did a great job explaining everything that happens at the eco farm and how well the camels are taken care of how. They are all rescues which is amazing! They seem a lot happier and healthier than camels I saw at Cactus Tours. The lunch was great too! Buffet style with lots of vegetarian options. I took one star away from my review for two reasons - our driver on the way back to our hotels was texting almost the entire time. He was not focused on the road and it was scary. The second reason is for the company‚Äôs decision to offer dolphin experiences. I think at this point everyone knows how sad and exploitative that industry is. They do so much good at their eco farm that it surprised me the same company has dolphins in captivity.",,,4
119,4 months ago,This tour was amazing! How many people can say they have ridden a camel?! The ATV portion and lunch/tequila tasting was well done too.

The photographer, Marco, took EXCELLENT pictures. We normally don‚Äôt buy the pictures but these were a must. We decided to go with the signature dolphin swim, which is the most expensive and longest option. I would highly recommend just going for this option as you feel you really have a whole experience.

Obviously this is not the staff‚Äôs fault, but it was not communicated to us well and we hopped out of the water early because we were banking on swimming in the other bay, and had we been informed earlier, I think several of us would have stayed in the water longer because it was our only stop.

When that wasnít it we called again and they basically told us they to go fly a kite. No refund, no rescheduling nothing. I was going to make them put a finger on the map down in the marina at their office, but they told my wife no. I would not trust this company with anything.

I would recommend these trips, the only negatives were some jellyfish stings snorkeling and the zip lines are over an hour drive away.

160,7 months ago,"Some good and some bad to say about the Arch & Camel tour.
Let me say that Cabo Adventures is totally pro and will give you peace of mind over any potentially-sketchy tour operators. So you're paying for that confidence.
The highlight of our day was the 400hp boat ride around 'El Arco'. Good low-speed commentary and some powerful high-speed awesomeness. Our guide even took great pictures on our own cameras. Tip your boat driver/captain.
Then 45 minutes to the eco-farm. The driving and vehicle were both good. I expected to pay the 20USD entrance fee, as I thought it was a national park or something like that. No, it's owned by Cabo Adventures! It should just be included in the brochure price.
The camel ride was underwhelming but at least I can now say we've ridden a camel. If you're discreet enough, you can sneak a phone into your pocket and take a couple of pics, but it's impossible to take a decent selfie while you're riding a camel, so not really worth it to covertly sneak your phone/camera.
The photography aspect of all these tours sucks (not just Cabo Adventures). The photographer took great photos (and drone video), but wanted 48USD for ONE photo of you and a camel. The package was almost $200.
Another review said that the 'eco presentation' was long and drawn out but that wasn't our experience. The meal was decent, and have as many tequila shots as you want. Our tour guide Pablo worked so hard. He was truly amazing and we tipped accordingly.
45 minutes ride back to the marina. Pick-up was included to and from our hotel (Riu Palace).
There were no extra toll fees or insurance (you sign a waiver) but they'll ask you for a 'group tip', although no pressure. The insurance that some complain about paying is only for ATV (and similar) tours.
In hindsight, I would have just paid $20-30 for a boat tour from a marina vendor, skipped all the rest, and saved a bunch of money to spend elsewhere.",7 months ago,"We thank you for taking the time to write your experience with us, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.The information of the additional charges is made clear on all of our promotional material, as well as our website on the ""What you need to know before you book"" section on each adventure.

161,8 months ago,"We did the snorkel, paddleboard, kayak and water scooter tour. The tour includes pickup from your hotel. On our tour, we took the banana boat speedboat out to Chileno Bay. That ride is about 40mins, and you pass by all the huge mansions. On the way out from the marina, we rode by the Arch of Los Cabos, Lover's Beach, Divorce Beach, Scooby Doo rock, and where the Sea of Cortez meets the Pacific Ocean(Land's End). Me & my wife decided to kayak in the Sea of Cortez, after realizing snorkeling was tough due to the strong waves. Kayaking was fun. I appreciated that we snorkeled in an area where it wasn't crowded with other tours. Equipment is in decent to good shape, but the sea scooter isn't as fast as you think. The crew was nice. A great tour for the price. We had cheese quesadillas at the end, which was more like a snack. The marina facility is pretty big.",8 months ago,Thank you for visiting us at Cabo Adventures!

180,5 months ago,"Update: Watch out when you get your bill for your excursions and review it carefully!  I was overcharged approx $150 for 2 excursions here by the concierge team at my hotel, and I was told I could easily take care of it once I fully checked out and got home.  That has not happened at all, and it has been an ongoing struggle to get a straight answer.I have been working with Cesar from my hotel and Aldo from Cabo Adventures via email to get a refund for the difference between the discounted price I was entitled to and the regular price they charged me.  The refund I'm requesting amounts to less than 8% of my total bill for the hotel, and I'm frustrated that I was asked to pay in full before we were able to resolve the overcharging.When you book excursions with Cabo Adventures, be sure to verify the prices and get it in writing on your receipt!  I won't be visiting here again or recommending it to others until this overcharge issue is fully resolved.-----Swimming with a beautiful dolphin (Kahal) felt both exciting and inspiring. Eric helped us get acquainted with him in the water, and you could really tell he had a good relationship with the dolphin. Saul took some classy & also some funny photos of us that will definitely end up on our Instagram! The pricing was fair: $170/pp for 1 hour of time. The photos/videos were $200 and included some really cool shots!Then we decided to try indoor skydiving, and it was fantastic! Easy to get started but tough to master. Margarita was a great teacher, and Emmanuel made sure we were safe in the wind tunnel. Miguel ran the controls, and we felt very safe in their hands. I hope to try it again next time!",,,1

196,6 months ago,"We did 2 tours with Cabo Adventures and they were both amazing.1st we did a private sailing trip. Jesus was our guide, Bruno was the captain, and Mariella was the photographer. We had so much fun. The drinks were flowing, the snack boxes were good, and Jesus was a great DJ. The wind wasn't blowing much but they still put out the sails which was so calming and amazing. Highly recommend.Next we did the luxury whale watching and I believe Jose was our guide. The luxury whale watching was nice because it was a cool catamaran and you didn't have to wear life jackets but the downside is the boats can't get as close to the whales. We saw quite a few pods of whales and even a baby which they said was the first they've seen this season. Jose was so genuine and knowledgeable about whales that it made it even better.I don't think you could go wrong with Cabo adventures.I personally wouldn't do the swim with dolphins but that my personal issue with dolphins in enclosures.",,,5

I'd recommend these tours to adults over 18 and wouldn't recommend children under 17, but I'm just being fickle because it was far more ""adventurous and fun"" with adults! The only regret, I didn't take a Go-Pro!!! The sailing trip was freaking awesome; I think we were on boat #2, and Saul was a hit, ""you signed up for sailing, and we are going to sail""!!The snorkeling adventure at Pulmo was fantastic, saw sharks, sea turtles, and everything else!!! We spent a lot of time in the water, and it was well worth the 2-hour drive!!!",11 months ago,"On behalf of everyone at Cabo Adventure, we truly appreciate your kind words and look forward to next time!Warm regards",5

205,a year ago,"Chaotic experience at their hub with lots of add ons. We spent about 4 hours (ride to ‚Äúhub,‚Äù waiting waiting waiting, sign in, go sit and wait, waiting for last people on group to arrive, walk to boat, go out on boat, walk back through photography area (really wish they were more proactive about communicating this) and then waiting waiting wait for a ride back to hotel. We were on the water for 90 minutes max.If they‚Äôd proactively ask about photos, and maybe ‚Äúany photos you want‚Äù I‚Äôd be more open to it!We did a sailboat adventure. Food was good, drinks were good.

208,a year ago,"During our trip we were lucky enough to partake in 2 activities with this company.On our first day we partook in ‚ÄúDolphin Trainer for a Day‚Äù and were not disappointed. Not only did we get 2 amazing dolphin encounters, we got to see everything behind the scenes. Literally, everything. From the offices, to the fish house, to the pools not accessible to the general public, no rock went unturned. We had the unique ability to meet all the dolphins, most of the trainers, vets, and more that help keep the dolphins well. We learned so much about the upkeep of the animals and facts about them. We even got to watch the recorded birth of one of their youngest dolphins. There are a few more secrets I won‚Äôt spoil, but the trainer who took us under her wing, Maria, was excellent. She so kind and willing to help, as well as knowledgeable and lighthearted. It is evident through her and the rest of the staff how much they truly care about the dolphins. Additionally, this package includes lunch, a few photos to remember your day by, as well as a hat and exclusive t-shirt. It is a lengthier experience and it will definitely leave you tired, but I could not recommend it more.On day two, we embarked on the sunset sail aboard a sailboat. The 3 member crew was delightful and extremely hospitable. We took the same cruise 4 years ago and loved it, and the same goes now. This is a great way to spend an evening, wether in a small or large group. Even though you‚Äôll most likely be intermingled with others, you never feel crowded on the boat. There are restrooms on board and food and drinks are served.Transportation to and from your hotel are $5 a person round trip, regardless of where you‚Äôre staying. Our hotel was approximately 30 minutes away and cab rides typically cost around $30, so definitely worth it. Pickup from the hotel has a set time and they were promptly on time. Shuttling back to the hotel you may have to wait a little bit, but we only waited around 15-25 minutes on either day.One thing to note is tips are not included in your original price. The guides, crew, and drivers are all exceptionally hospitable and friendly, but please note that they do make a substantial amount of their money from tips. Be sure to budget that into your plans, and bring cash if you so please. I also feel inclined to mention that picture prices are a bit alarming to most people. In my opinion, however, they are well priced, and I am a photographer by trade. I‚Äôll give you my two references and allow you to decide for yourself. Day one (dolphin trainer), included 3 people over the course of 4.5 hours and 131 photos/ videos for right around $300 (approx. $100 per person). Day 2 (sunset sailboat) included 5 people over the course of 2 hours and around 25 pictures for $240 (approx. $48 per person). All of these were instant digital delivery, but the Dolphin Trainer experience included 2 physical prints per person. Why I say this is reasonably charged: the average photographer in my area (Houston, TX) charges $350 for a 1 hour individual photo session with around 20-25 photos being delivered. So their pictures prices are in the right ballpark as far as I‚Äôm concerned, which is surprising considering the usual tourism markup rate of other companies I‚Äôve encountered.All in all, this is the only company I‚Äôd recommend. I‚Äôve partook in 4 different experiences with them over the years and have yet to be disappointed. While there are cheaper options, you get what you pay for, and Cabo Adventures is nothing short of good and consistent service.",a year ago,"Thank you for having taken the time to post your wonderful review of Cabo Adventures and sharing how much you enjoyed your adventure.

The fish aren‚Äôt small and they bite. I asked several times for him to stop, and he continued to through the bread even as I was trying to get out of the water.  I had several bites on my hands.

214,4 weeks ago,"We did the signature swim, and I will start by saying our trainer (Gris) and the experience was amazing. We had such a good time.So, why the 2 star review? Here's why...First, you are not allowed to bring your phone/camera to the pool. Once we got finished we were excited to get the pictures our photographer took. We went into the building and they showed them to us. They looked good. But at the end of the presentation, they asked for $240 to $400 for them. It totally ruined the entire experience. It is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous to ask that much for some pictures/videos. We were completely disappointed and left without having anything to share with friends/family about our experience.The day prior to this, we were ziplining at wild canyon. Our photographer trekked the mountains in the heat right along with us take our pictures. At the end, we bought them for $110. The girl that took our pictures here just stood at the edge of the pool and pressed a button on the camera for an hour and they want $240+ for those?  No thanks!It's a shame places like this ruin their reputation to attempt to rip you off at the end of a fun experience.I am sure I will get the same canned response from them about how their prices are fair, as they have to every other post. But no. As stated above, our zipline photographer trekked mountains in the heat taking our pictures and the cost was $110....  So, instead of getting something in that range, they got $0 from us.COMPLETELY disappointed.",,,2

217,6 days ago,"Beware! The booking price you see is about 1/2 the final price you will end up paying. My boyfriend and I booked a combo tour (camel, atv and tequila) for 300$. When we arrived we were told we had to pay an additional 110$ for insurance and park entry. Now the 3 hour excursion is 410$. Next, we enjoyed the tour, but we‚Äôre told we couldn‚Äôt have our phones, or take ANY of our own photographs; they had a photographer capturing the moments. At the end of the tour, we were coerced into buying overpriced drinks and lunch (which the people made it sound like we‚Äôre included in the already $$$ price of the adventure but in fact were not). Next, we were shown the photos they took and told they were over 200$ to purchase. Not to mention having to decide right then and there to drop that kind of money. So this has turned into a > 600$ 3 hour excursion for 2 people. Talking to customer service in the days following our tour trying to preview our photos and decide if they are worth the outrageous price - has been a total waste of time and energy. The tour itself was lovely, however every other aspect of this experience has been horrific and deterred us from booking though caboo adventures for any other activity throughout our stay in cabo",,,1

221,a year ago,"After having been on several snorkeling excursions all over the world, I can honestly say that this one was hands down the best. From start to finish this company is a well-oiled machine. We were picked up on-time from our hotel in an air conditioned van, everyone was masked up & the driver was super friendly.   The crew was exceptional and really made this tour memorable. They were incredibly attentive & knowledgeable. We had the privilege of seeing several whales on our way back in and they took the time to stop and let everyone experience it (one of the whales appeared out of nowhere RIGHT BESIDE THE BOAT! Absolute highlight of 2021). The crew were also very excited about the whales which was very refreshing. The photographer took a ton of pictures throughout the day & they turned out great. You always had a drink in your hand & the lunch they provided was fresh and delicious. I had a bit of a mishap with the sea scooter (my bikini top got stuck in the propeller in the water üòÇ) and the crew handled it super professionally and discreetly.

255,4 months ago,"Very disappointing tour! Cabo Adventures check in staff was very friendly and attentive. But it all changed when we got onboard the sailboat with captain Erick. The tour was supposed to last 2 and a half hours, but captain Erick returned our sailboat to the Pier, after only 1 hour 45 minutes!! He offered to sail through Sea of Cortes, but √≠nstead he kept the boat in a still position for long periods of time. I thought the purpose of the tour was to sail!! During these long periods of nothing, my son wanted to film with his drone. Once again, captain Erick very rudely didn‚Äôt allow him to do so with no valid explanation. Suddenly my daughter saw whales nearby. We asked captain Erick if we could go a little closer to see them. He answered rudely that our tour was not a whale-watching tour, and that he would be late for our return. Late?? He cut off our tour 45 minutes earlier!!! The bright side of our experience, was that we did get to see other whales on our way back. This actually improved our overall experience. Finally it was very uncomfortable having Est√©ban (the other staff member) helping you get off the boat with one hand and holding a hat in his other hand while DEMANDING VERY RUDELY that he was expecting a tip!! (Which he of course didn‚Äôt receive at all). Is this a luxury sailing experience?? I seriously doubt it!!",,,2
256,a year ago,"Paola from Cabo Adventures truly provided me with a once in a lifetime experience... Not only have I never swam with dolphins before, but I have never even seen one in person prior to visiting Cabo San Lucas. After some tough convincing my fiance was able to persuade me to join her in swimming with these lovely dolphins. Why did it take persuasion you might ask? Because I'm deathly afraid of large animals, specifically anything that lives in water. But Paola was not only able to calm my nerves and teach me a lot about these beautiful animals, but she made me feel comfortable enough to the point where I decided to dive to the bottom of the pool holding on to one of these magnificent creatures!!If you decide to come here and are brave enough, make sure you go for the full experience!! It's worth every penny... As well afterwards, make sure you pick up the full package for photos and videos of your experience!! These are memories that my fiance and I will cherish for a lifetime and more. Highly recommend!!",a year ago,"Thank you for your amazing review and comments, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.We can't wait to see you again and create more fun memories!",5
257,a year ago,I took my daughter here for her birthday and we had the best experience.  Paola was our guide and she was so knowledgeable and taught us so much about dolphins and dolphin conservation.All of the staff were amazing from the moment we walked into the faculty we had someone walk us to check in.  The check in staff were friendly and upbeat.  Did not feel any pressure at all to purchase any other adventures.  After that we were sent over to another staff member who took us to our lockers.I can not wait to come back with my other family members.,a year ago,"Thank you for your amazing review and comments, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.We can't wait to see you again and create more fun memories!Hasta Pronto!",5
258,3 months ago,"This experience was not great. We did the ‚Äúluxury sunset sailboat‚Äù cruise. First, we were told to check in 45 minutes before the experience started. We got there at 3:45, and it took maybe 30 seconds to check in. We waited around for almost an hour, they didn‚Äôt even call our group until 4:29 (tour started at 4:30). I have never heard of an excursion requiring you to show up so early just to sit around. Then, on the boat, they sailed for about 20 minutes and then we sat in the middle of the water for almost 2 hours hardly moving. Not really a ‚Äúcruise‚Äù. For some reason, when the sun was setting, the ship didn‚Äôt move towards the ocean where the rest of the ships were. We were hundreds of yards away from the other ships, and our view was obstructed by the mountains. We didn‚Äôt fully get to see the sunset because we didn‚Äôt move away from the mountains like all of the other boats did. They played horrible music the whole time too. It was a very overrated experience- I‚Äôd recommend booking with a smaller company. The sunset was beautiful- but that had nothing to do with Cabo adventures. They also left to turn back around the second the sun had set. The sky turned beautiful colors after the sun went down and it was still very bright out, but for some reason we were rushed back to the dock. We ended up losing a total of 12 minutes because we left a few minutes late and came back early.",,,3

260,a year ago,"We visited Cabo in early May and booked 3 adventures with Cabo Adventures - Luxury Sailing, Camel Combo (Camels, ATV, & Eco Farm), and Dolphin Trainer for a Day

The Luxury Sailing Tour was great! The captain and crew were experts and knew exactly what they were doing. Saul was part of the crew and he was fantastic! I cannot remember the captain's name, but he was great, too. Rocsi, the photographer, was also nice. Please note, however, if you've never been sailing, the boat tips A LOT when the sails go up. I had never been sailing and didn't know what to expect. Thankfully, I was able to sit in the back of the boat during the sailing portion (which was only about 45 mins-1 hour of the whole 4 hour experience) because I was not particularly fond of the sailing. But overall it was still a great experience, and you receive a snack, lunch, and unlimited drinks.

The Camel Combo was awesome! Be aware this tour is about an hour away from Cabo, so factor in travel time if you make other plans for the day. You first tour the Eco Farm and learn about how they recycle plastics from all over, and also how they make chocolate. Isha was a great tour guide. Then you take a short ride on the camels on the beach. It was so much fun. We also go to take pictures with Jefferson the Camel. I can't remember our camel guides name, but he was younger and gave us so much great information about the camels! Finally, we got to ride on the ATVs. Our guides Bryan and Noriega were fantastic. We had an awesome time, and we also had a tequila tasting at the end. I forget our photographer's name (he was shorter and had curly hair), but he was fantastic! I would say he took the best photos from all of our experiences with Cabo Adventures.

The Dolphin Trainer for a Day Experience was THE BEST! It is WELL worth the money, and I recommend this dolphin experience over all the others. You definitely get more for your money doing the Dolphin Trainer for a Day. When we arrived we received a free t-shirt and hat before immediately going to learn about the dolphins. We learned how they are checked every morning to make sure they are healthy, have an appetite, and if they want to participate with people that day. If the dolphins don't want to participate, they aren't forced to. It is their choice each day if they want to interact with guests, and they are never punished. We toured the facility and learned how the dolphins were taken care of, what they eat, how the water is filtered, etc. We got to swim with the dolphins, help train one of the baby dolphins, and then learn commands and work with the dolphins one-on-one. Our trainer Paola was AMAZING and a great trainer. Lunch is also included in this package. The photo packages are SUPER expensive for this experience, however, they say the money goes back into caring for the dolphins. So be prepared to spend money on the photos if you want them. We bought them because it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Overall, Cabo Adventures is great, and we will definitely book with them again if we're ever in Cabo again! We bought the photo packages at each experience and went in with the mindset of buying the photo packages, so we made sure to put aside extra money for that ahead of time. We did not feel hassled for tips like some other comments mentioned, but we did tip all of our guides, photographers, and transportation drivers because they all provided excellent service. I highly recommend Cabo Adventures for any of their experiences when you visit Cabo!",a year ago,Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience at Cabo Adventures!

262,2 months ago,Richard Noriega the best tour guide in all of Cabo. Homeboy is super funny and informative. Makes adventures super fun,,,5
263,a year ago,"Great finish. Terrible start. ATV ADVENTURE.First off let me tell you we had a great time in the end. Most of all the staff were absolutely amazing and fun. Shout out to our ATV guides and photographers. Damian, Bicri, Rolando Rodriguez and Adrian. Super funny and caring.Food at the end was excellent. We enjoyed a tasty buffet and had a fun time tequila tasting with a nice view of the ocean.Photos were incredible. Even though they were pricey ($100 plus for over 30 electronic copies and one 5x7print) we bought them as this was a special memory/event for us and the pics were outstanding.Now for the downside.When we arrived to check in at the desk we were charged an additional $20 per person for the ‚Äúentrance fee‚Äù. This we were told about when we bought the tickets through Discova at our hotel.  Then we were told we had to pay $30 plus per person for insurance. Seriously? LAME! You‚Äôre an hour away already at the place. What are you going to do? Leave?  No. Forced to pay. Cabo Advebtures should include ALL fee from the start in the overall price of the tour.THEN. After the hour long drive to the location and paying the additional fees we were forced to listen to an hour long ‚ÄúECO TOUR‚Äù that no one (all 40 tourists in our group ) was expecting. First ‚Äútalk‚Äù was About how they turned camel poo into paper. Then they passed the paper around for us to touch. GROSS. PASS. After that we had a sweet but boring explanation about how cacao is used to make chocolate.  WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED to NOT waste that precious hour of vacation and get on to the activity we paid for.Honesty is the best policy. And letting us know that the 3 hour tour included a one hour ‚Äúpresentation‚Äù about camel poo and chocolate would have been important to know.  Would have given them 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for the extra charges and the presentation.",a year ago,"Dear Virginia Huffman,Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience with us, we appreciate your feedback.

266,4 months ago,"Just got back from Cabo for my birthday trip. We booked a snorkeling with whale sharks experience, but unfortunately it was cancelled due to sea conditions. Cabo Adventures was very accommodating letting us (a group of 4) choose a different activity and refunded the difference in price. We did the ATVs and camel ride with lunch and it was great! They even did a little tequila tasting with lunch. Everything was well organized and we still saw humpback whales from the shore during our camel ride. Hopefully we can try again another time for whale shark snorkeling. Would definitely book a tour with these guys again.",,,5

I would probably check out a higher end one next time in Cabo.",,,3

271,2 months ago,"We had a great time here! Max was our guide, and our dolphin's name was Jagale (or something like that!). The dolphins were super friendly and safe for the kids, and did some incredible tricks. Our kids even got to ride them. It was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience!",,,5
272,3 months ago,"We did the dolphin experience and the experience itself was fantastic.The scam side of this business came out fast though. You expect some of it with the touristy aspect, but they charged us $7/person to get picked up in their shuttle that the email implied was free. The shuttle took over an hour (way longer than if we had just drove) because it stopped at two other resorts before dropping us off. They also didn't inform us of the transportation cost until we got there and of course wouldn't let us do our experience unless we paid it. They're also pressuring you because if you argue with them too long they said we'd miss the time for our experience with no refund. Basically pay it or we'll screw you out of more money.Then the pictures for the experience were outrageous. We expected something along the lines of ""You get 10 pics of your choice for $100 dollars"" or something like that. They don't inform you of the price beforehand. Turns out it was $360 for all the photos digitally and that's the bare minimum. They claimed it was so expensive because there were 5 people in our group. You don't even get ripped for that much in the USA. Then when I asked to see the slideshow again to see if it was truly worth it the guy accused me of only wanting to see it again so I could secretly record it. That was the last straw so we walked away and he came after us saying, ""Actually I can do it for $290."" Still a total scam. The pictures were great, I'd want to have them, but not at that insane pricing.So in closing, the experience we purchased was great. The scamming of everything around it ruined the outing overall.---EDIT---After posting my review I scrolled one star reviews and found plenty of people complaining about the scam surprise pricing and if you look at Cabo Adventure's responses to all those reviews it's amazingly copy/paste. ""The money for those photos helps us provide better care for the dolphins."" Except, it's an extra, that is not part of the cost of seeing the dolphins. And priced so insane that I didn't see a single group that was around us by them either. So, they chose scam pricing structure, that is comparable to ""5-star experiences"" around them (Ha! to 5-star) but yet they made zero money off of it. If it was truly ""for the dolphins "" they'd price them so they'd sell. But instead they made $0 ""for the dolphins."" I'm pretty sure the $18/minute 20 minute experience finances the dolphins just fine and we can all see the $360 photos are nothing but a scam cash grab. I'm lowering my review to one star based on their canned self serving response.",3 months ago,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are glad to read this educational and interactive session with our dolphin and marine mammal specialist was a fun experience for you.It is important to mention that transportation is an optional service that we offer from most hotels in Los Cabos, should you not wish to take advantage of this service, all guests are welcome to make their own transportation arrangements covering their own cost. Transportation service is included for some activities, and for others like dolphin programs, it has an additional cost of $7 usd per person. You can find all details including program duration and what is included on each tour in all our promotional material, such as brochures, magazines as well as our website on the ""What you need to know before you book"" section on each adventure.Regarding the pictures, our prices are competitive with other internationally recognized, 5-star dolphinariums similar to our facilities. The money from the swims & photos covers for the care, maintenance, and enrichment for our dolphin family. Furthermore, the profit made from the pictures allows us to do research on marine mammals, and efforts related to rescue, rehabilitation, and release of marine animals in need.If there is anything else we can do for you, please contact us at customerservicephoto@cabo-adventures.com",1

I was a Cruise Ship passenger.  I arrived right at the tour starting time.  I was asked to provide physical ID.  I only had 3 forms of ID on my phone which I provided.  Unfortunately they could not take them.  I spoke to the Manager, Karin, who told me that they do not allow Cruise Passengers to book their tours and she stated an email was sent to my account.  100% it did not get to me.  She spent 10 minutes looking for it on my phone and could not find it.  Thus, she told me that 100% they sent it and 100% that I received it, basically calling me a liar. Then after not finding it, she said it does not matter anyway, your tour has now departed.I insisted on a refund and she denied it.

Our return driver then shook us down for money for the toll roads. I‚Äôve been to Cabo 10+ times, that is not normal and these companies have toll passes for the drivers! Unacceptable behavior from their drivers, the first and last point of contact to your customers are disgraceful.The positives: everyone of the event facilitators at CA is top notch. From Eisha at the Eco Farm, to Bill and Riccardo with the Camels, and Mario, Bryan, David and Daniel,  the videographers and photographer, and the lunch crew at the restaurant,are superb! They are fun, high energy but also highly safe! Truly a great team!Now, they just need to get rid of the dangerous and  shady drivers. Come on Cabo Adventures!! You can do better. üò©",11 months ago,"Dear Monica BordenWe thank you for sharing your experience with us, please accept our most sincere apologies, for the inconvenience during your visit; it is definitely not acceptable for our standards that we are always proud to uphold, we thank you in advance for sharing more details at info@cabo-adventures, in order to identify your reservation and drivers.From all of us on our team, we thank you again for bringing this situation to our attention and truly hope you give us the opportunity to welcome you back in the near future.",2

It seems like the group before us got quite a bit more time to be honest. The worst part was when we left to go buy some pictures. The price is insane! If you want pictures, be prepared to buy them all as they are not selling individual! My kids ended up crying and that ruined the whole experience for us! The smallest package was $279 US I believe and $374 for the expensive one! I begged them to sell me one picture but they wouldn't do that. Two other families were with us and upset kids as well! One was a photographer herself and couldn't believe how overcharged those photos were and the fact that couldn't just by one!

On the way we were able to see some jumping sting rays as well as a whale breaching the water. They provided all the gear for us to snorkel at at Chileno Bay, and we were also able to kayak, paddle board and even use those underwater diving scooters. On the way back we drove the boat around to see El Arco, Land's End, Lover's Beach, Divorce Beach & Neptune's Finger. All in all a great tour.",,,5

Unfortunately, after the experience they wanted about $400 for photos. There is no option of buying a single pic for $50 or something similar. It was $400 for all or nothing. That left such a bad taste in my mouth for what was otherwise a great experience. Just go into it accepting that you won't have any photos and you won't be disappointed.",,,3

Mareclino was passionate about sharing the culture and history of the area and was so friendly. They provided a traditional road trip breakfast of a beans and cheese wrap and coffee with cinnamon and it was delicious.

336,4 years ago,"We booked a whale-watching tour with Cabo Adventures through the concierge at our resort.  We chose the 2-hour tour on a small inflatable raft that held about 18 people on bench seats.  Their headquarters are conveniently located at the Cabo marina -- staff were friendly and helpful and the facilities were clean and comfortable while we waited for our tour to begin.  Once your group is called, it's a short walk to a nearby pier where life vests are distributed and you board the raft.  The ride itself was smooth and pleasant (don't bother wearing a hat unless it's securely tied on) and the raft was clean and well maintained. At the beginning, they stopped at The Arch for a photo opp, which was a nice bonus.  Our tour guide seemed knowledgable and was able to answer any question we threw his way -- we especially appreciated the fact that this organization respects the environment and the whales themselves.  While we didn't see any dramatic whale leaps during our tour, we saw plenty of breaches and a few small jumps.  Definitely recommend this operator -- very fun.",,,5

352,a month ago,"This one star is not necessarily for my guides. They were amazing people. Marliz was also amazing and friendly. What bothered me was that our jet ski had a malfunction causing the jet ski to retain water while me and my girlfriend rode. When we got to the turning point we ended up tipping back which then turned into us falling in the water. The crew was helpful and did what they do best which was help us. We had to hitch a ride back on the main boat since we couldnt ride our jet ski back to the main spot. Our guides told us to go to the main desk to see if we could get a refund. So we did and the lady was so nonchalant about it. Only option we had was to reschedule for another but we already have plans. So i was not able to get a refund.

361,3 months ago,"I went on the catamaran sailing tour with my friend March 20th at 10:00 AM. We were on boat X (or ten). Our tour was with Jesus, Victoria, Chino and a rude captain whose name I forgot. This review is not about Chino or Victoria. Victoria was absolutely amazing, going out of her way to make sure we had the best experience.My friend and I were the only black people on this tour, and we were treated unfairly by Jesus and the captain. I wish I could remember the captain‚Äôs name because he is the reason for this bad review. On the 4-hour trip, I asked him 2 questions and he acted like it was an inconvenience for him. He was very impatient and uninterested towards us yet he was going above and beyond to cater to the needs of the other guests. He did not help me with the paddle boards, while he assisted the other guests. They did not check on us like they did the other guests. They did not help us get off the boat, when they held their hand out for the other guests. And at the end when we tipped them a few dollars (because of their bad service), the captain said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that.‚ÄùI know this is not reflective of the company, as the others who assisted us at the meeting place were nice.

Instead we were put on a charter bus that had 4 stops prior to leaving.  When our trip was over we couldn't leave for an hour until other people could fill the bus on the return.    The Polaris adventure was awefull.  They said it was two hours and we would go through rivers and ride on the beach.  The river was homemade and we never got to ride on the beach. The ride was only one hour and then one hour at a restaurant.  Worst experience ever.Once our charter bus filled up we had to make 4 more stops letting people off.   We spend 3 hours on a bus and one hour on our polaris.   Avoid this company at all costs.,,,1
371,4 years ago,Passed on paying $138 per person for the Carnival cruise excursion and did this one for $30 per person (after haggling of course) and bought our own lunch and drinks in an air conditioned restaurant. This tour took us around lands end and stopped at several beaches. Came back to get us after spending an hour on one beach.,,,5
372,3 months ago,"3/5 stars due to Cabo Adventures convincing us to go to a ‚Äògolf package‚Äô sales pitch when in actuality it was a 3 hr timeshare presentation. Despite this, we only paid $15/pp for the 2-Bay ‚Äòluxury sailing‚Äô excursion.Luxury is a stretch since there were ~ 30 of us on board a catamaran. Open bar was great and the highlight! Drinks were strong - and flowing (haha). The guides were very nice and charming :-)We were served a bento box of fruit and yogurt before a tasty sandwich lunch after snorkeling!Overall, not sure I would want to pay $100+ for this experience.",,,3
373,3 months ago,"This is a world-class tourist trap. We spent over $450 for a bad day. Extra charges, bad food, creepy tour guides - little everything here is overpriced, underwhelming, and completely overrated.Starting with the $20 per person entry fee to get into the ‚Äòpark‚Äô, the $35 insurance fee per person for the super lame ATV tour (never went over 15 mph, only lasted 30 mins), and the $20 lunch per person. Then the pictures were $180 bucks for the cheapest thing‚Ä¶ you couldn‚Äôt even take your own.Furthermore, this creepy guide kept hitting on my girlfriend and was all over every woman in the group‚Ä¶. My girlfriend was so uncomfortable the rest of the time, it literally ruined her time.Wish I could take my money back and my time back, and forget about this horrible experience. Do yourself a favor, and rent a boat instead. This is totally lame in every way imaginable",,,1
374,a year ago,"Edson our trainer, and Juan our photographer did a wonderful job.  Our dolphin, Liz was sweet, beautiful, smart, majestic & beyond my imagination.  At times, our experience did feel a bit rushed and slightly overly scripted.  Also, the packages do not include the photos - so whatever you spend up front, expect to double it for photos and tips and the like.  That all said - it is really a once in a lifetime experience to be with these beautiful animals... and if you're in Cabo, it is well worth the $.  Do the VIP experience to get the most time with the dolphins... And have cash on hand in the right denominations for tipping - no one has any change.  The dolphins are well cared for and happy.  Watching them play together up close was pretty spectacular.  ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,4
375,4 months ago,"Overall, we really enjoyed the whale watching activity. We saw several humpbacks and a gray whale. A baby humpback kept breaching near us as it seemed to be in a playful mood. Between the yacht and the captain, the y kept the ride pleasant even though the water was a little turbulent at times. I never felt the least bit seasick or unsafe. The crew did a good job of keeping everyone‚Äôs glass full, however I will say  the lunch was nothing exceptional. The tour guide was knowledgeable, but sometimes he was hard to understand because he talked very fast and had a thick accent when speaking English. After we had seen numerous whales, they put a listening device in the water so we could hear the whales communicating, but it did not work. It was a great experience but there were some areas for potential improvement.",4 months ago,"Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience with us, we are glad to know you had a good time.All our guides are bilingual, some even are trilingual, and we are extremely proud of their skills and knowledge, if the guide was speaking too fast for you we encourage all of our guests to feel free to ask our team members to slow down with their speech or repeat what was said, as guest experience is a must for us.Thank you again for your time and visit.

379,5 months ago,When we stopped at the Cabo adventures booth to book a tour we were asked what we wanted to do. We said we were interested in a tour that combined snorkeling and whale watching and booked the tour that was suggested. The only whales we saw were very far away and there was no attempt to get closer. Throughout the entire tour there was loud music blaring over the speakers - it was essentially a party boat - and no mention about whales at all. When we booked the tour we were told snorkeling equipment was included but they did not supply flippers. We were also told when we booked that we would have 1 hr to snorkel - we got maybe 15 minutes and were confined to a small area where there were hardly any fish. We were constantly being herded into a small area all together. The food they served for lunch was good. And the drinks were good.,5 months ago,"Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience with us.We are glad that you enjoyed food and drinks on board. Although snorkeling is an important attribute of our sailing experience, we have more outstanding activities around this tour, for this reason we only dedicate 45 for snorkeling. If you are looking for an exclusive snorkeling tour, we highly recommend our ""Snorkel and Sea Adventure"" and if you are looking for a whale watching tour we have 2 specific tours that dedicates to go search for whales but does not include snorkeling.Thank you for your time and visit, we hope to welcome you back soon!",1

381,3 years ago,"We did the Sea of Cortez tour, and we were generally happy with the tour.The way from San Lucas to the Sea of Espirito Santo Islan is exhausting; 2.5 hours drive, and another two hours cruise to the Sea Lions' colony. But from that moment, we were in paradise.We did snorkeling with the Sea Lions, which was one of the most magical experiences I had. The bay was beautiful, the visibility was great and there were lots of fish and cutie Sea Lion babies that swam very close to us.We then went up to the yacht where the tour guide and the crew served fresh lunch of nachos, sandwiches and ceviche, and we enjoyed the open bar, which was part of the package deal we bought.On the way back to La Paz, the yacht made an hour stop at on of bays of Espirito Santo Island. We snorkeled at the green and beautiful water there, played on the floating mattress and enjoyed the sun and the beautiful view.Our tour guide was very professional and nice. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that on the way back, the tour guide decided to make an unplanned stop at a local taco restaurant / supermarket / kiosk - not sure what this place was.",,,5
382,2 months ago,This review is for camel adventure. We also had the sunset cruise which we loved. The adventure was ok but they will nickel and dime you for everything. They don‚Äôt let you take your own cameras so you end up purchasing their overpriced pictures. They charge $25 per person for entry (in addition to what you paid for adventure) but if you pay in pesos they will charge at 20pesos to dollar. Just ripping off tourists. $125 for 15 mins of camel ride and no pictures to relive. Don‚Äôt waste your money.,,,2
383,2 years ago,"Unique experience, we went on a little adventure to see DOLPHINS ‚ù§Ô∏è never in my life did I think I‚Äôd have this opportunity but thankfully I did. We got to play around with a baby dolphin and learnt about her too. She was amazing and did tricks for us, played around with us, and even took us for a ride! You are provided with a life vest, but fair warning the pool is pretty deep (>10ft) and if you‚Äôre scared don‚Äôt risk it, it‚Äôs all still fun without coming off the edge. Pretty pricey for the pictures and videos so please keep that in mind.",2 years ago,"Thank you for your 5-star opinion!

I understand this is an ethically certified facility, however I cannot find any info on where Cabo Adventures gets its dolphins from. It is one thing if they have been bred in captivity or wouldn't survive in the wild, but I can't support it if the dolphins are being taken from their homes in the ocean. No matter how nicely you treat them, a tank is way too small in comparison. I'd be happy to upgrade my review if the business can provide some more education or context on this.",,,3

We booked in advance direct from the website  the ATV Desert Adventure, specifically the 2 Person ATV.Please note, there is an EXTRA $20 per person Entrance Fee and a mandatory damage $35 Fee per ATV vehicle. These fees are paid upon arrival to Tierra Sagrada which is where some of the adventures take place.Moving on. Transportation is included from MOST resorts.

The bus ride is about 50 minutes and is communicated by the driver prior to departure. Our adventure, as stated online takes 4 hours. NOTE the time listed online is the total time of your excursion ONLY. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE TRAVEL TIME. Our excursion was scheduled for 9am-1pm. So. We got picked up at our hotel at 7:15am and LEFT Tierra Sagrada at 1:00pm. This is NOT a complaint, just something to be aware of.We really enjoyed our adventure. Isha and Greta were our guides for the Eco Farm. Although they did a great job and provided interesting information, I think many would not care for the Eco Farm tour. Damian and Richie was our ATV tour guide and they were so upbeat, friendly, and fun. We really enjoyed them.  We also got AMAZING pictures.

455,3 years ago,"We did the swim with whale sharks adventure. We were very pleased with the entire trip, and enjoyed it from start to finish. Oliver and Raz did a fantastic job. A morning snack (basically a full lunch) was provided on the way to La Paz, while they went over alot of facts and stories about the adventure and the surrounding area we were in. This was followed by a video about the Baja of California. Once in La Paz we got geared up and walked to the marina to board our boats.The trip had 18 ppl on it, so we took 2 boats out. We were surprised to learn how controlled this trip is with checking and getting registered to even get out to the area where the sharks are, to only allowing so any boats to be in the designated area, only 4 ppl allowed in the water at a time with the whale shark, each boat can only spend a max of 30mins with the whale shark as well. Mind you the local tour guides don't always seem to follow these rules.It was a beautiful day, and it was only the 2nd weekend of the season for the whale shark trip. There were only 2-3 whale sharks in our area. We got to swim with the same one on 2 different dives, and it was absolutely amazing to be in the water with these huge creatures. It was really breathtaking. Unfortunately the water was pretty cloudy, bit that also forced us to get within a few feet of them. The water was warm, and I was a glorious day, we even got to swim with a pod if dolphins.After the trip we rinsed off at the Cabo Adventures facility, and headed to a local restaurant for a tasty meal.

462,10 months ago,"I never go out of my way to write poor reviews but I‚Äôm just so disappointed with this company. I booked a beginner‚Äôs scuba diving tour and showed up to check in only for the desk worker to tell me the tour has been cancelled due to weather conditions. He (David) said that they were JUST informed of the news and the cancellation emails were sent out a short while ago. What I‚Äôm confused about is no one informed me when I called half an hour ago asking about the necessary attire. And it is 30 minutes past check in time and I have YET to receive the cancellation email. I was really looking forward to this tour and I am bummed that I‚Äôm leaving tomorrow. The only options are to get change to a later date, get credit, or a refund. I understand that weather/water conditions are out of the company‚Äôs control but the way this cancellation was handled is not it. When I explained my frustrations, what I got was ‚ÄúWe want the tour too, it‚Äôs good for you and we make money too‚Äù. I just wasted my time and money making the trip here. There are SO many tour companies asking for my business along the Marina and I will make sure to never book with Cabo Adventures ever again.",10 months ago,"Dear So Young Park,Firstly, we apologize for the inconvenience caused. As you can understand, the weather is not something we can control and for this reason, under orders from the Harbor Master, all activities out in the open water were canceled due to strong winds and currents. This is a decision that the authorities can implement from one minute to another, which was the case on August 6th, and for this reason, you were not notified in advance or when you called us previously. The welfare and safety of our guests is our top priority and to ensure this we will always follow the authority‚Äôs restrictions and recommendations.We understand your reluctance to consider joining us on an experience with us, however, know that we will always be willing to welcome you back with warm regards. We had around 400 guests to be contacted from one minute to another, we contacted guests as soon as possible.

466,3 months ago,The Dolphin tour was marketed as an individual experience when in reality you are there with 15 other families. I was over charged and not provided all of the experiences I paid for.

Shame on the owners for taking advantage of people.,3 months ago,"We appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to discuss your experience with us. It's my pleasure to inform you that we can arrange private dolphin programs so that your family is not with other guests, although our programs are for very small groups (8 per group).Our prices are competitive with other internationally recognized, 5-star dolphinariums similar to our facilities. The money from the swims & photos not only covers for the care, maintenance, and enrichment for our dolphin family but also allows us to provide you with well-trained, professional photographers and the best underwater equipment to capture that once-in-a-lifetime moment.The pricing of each package consists of the number of people in the group, the program in which you participate, and the type of package. If you should not wish to purchase the picture package, we do have an observation area where, at a safe distance, you can take pictures and observe the encounters taking place.Feel free to reach out with any further questions at info@cabo adventures.com.",1

473,3 months ago,"Booked an 8am whale watching tour a week in advance with a transfer. Morning of, our transfer arrived on time (6:50, which we thought was a little early?) and drive us to this large building with a photo center, gift shop and coffee shop to check in. The woman checking us in was surprised to see us and stated our tour had been cancelled and we would receive a phone call from someone in the office explaining why. After further communication, we agreed to be placed on a similar tour later in the morning. Since we missed our breakfast at our hotel to be at our 8am tour we were quite hungry and in need of coffee. Unfortunately, no offer was made for a food or coffee voucher to hold us over while we waited 2 hours at this venue for the replacement tour they had put us on. Would have expected better customer service.Additionally, DO NOT book the complimentary transfer. After our tour we then had to wait a full hour to get a ride back (as they leave on the hour ? We were not informed this at the time of booking). So we also ended up missing out lunch rezzo. A simple 2 hour whale subpar whale watching excursion became a full day event.",,,1

They presented me with 3 options about the course ahead and waited until I choose the best one for me at that time.  The gentleman were patient and understanding in my decision.

From timing the song hotel California to our arrival to the hotel perfectly and teaching us how to take tequila, Marcelino made this the HIGHLIGHT of my trip and I strongly recommend taking this tour ‚Äî especially with him as his enthusiasm, kindness and love for his culture and Los Cabos makes this tour a truly joyous experience. 10/10 would recommend!",,,5

503,3 years ago,"We went on two different adventures with this company, the snorkeling and the camel rides. I do not recommend the camel rides. It‚Äôs a long bus ride and then a long time talking about camels with a guy who is funny and nice, but not appropriate for children. The camel ride is about 20 mins but you don‚Äôt want it to be longer than that.They are really friendly.My experience with the snorkeling was really cool. We saw whales!

I surprised my wife with these two adventures and she has said over and over it was the best part of the trip. Even during COVID, the experience was unforgettable and there were less people than normal on the transportation and activities.Both crews were excellent Spanish and English speakers so all our questions were adequately answered and there were zero hidden fees from the website. Both crews were nice and got to know us and our names which were used throughout the whole day. Gear and equipment were high end and you can feel a strong importance for your safety. The food was great as well! The pick up from our hotel was right on time and they let us park for free at their marina l option when we were arriving but before check in.

510,11 months ago,They brought us from our hotel to the marina and then told us our boat tour and jet skis are cancelled. Then made us wait for more than 30 mins to get us a ride back to our hotel. They were not sorry and I had to really force the.to get us back to the hotel so we don't waste our time at their establishment just to go back. Overall a terrible experience.

527,a month ago,"We did the Magical Todos Santos and Camel Ranch, and it was the best decision we made. We were a group of 10 girls, the Marcelino, our tour guide was genuinely the best tour guide I‚Äôve had.The tour was 6-hour long and it was honestly not long enough, that‚Äôs just how amazing it was. It took an hour drive from our resort to the town, during the ride there, Marcelino regaled us with the history, legends, and myths about Los Cabos.Our first stop was the pearl factory, it was extremely informative and they had some amazing surprises for the crew. Marcelino then gives you the option of waking around town by yourself or he can show you around. I would highly recommend you choose to go with Marcelino, he has this passionate way of explaining the history of the town in a way where you feel like you‚Äôre reliving the history. He never got annoyed with us when we asked him to pause so we could take pictures, he was extremely sweet and funny.Next we visited Blanket Factory Justina where we learnt about blanket making. The tour was so great that my sister ended purchasing a hammock swing (which got a few laughs at the airport.Our last stop was at the Tierra Sagrada ranch. We took some hilarious pictures with the camel and had lunch. The food was spectacular, the ladies who provided the food were super sweet, and I would highly recommend the tamarind water.To end the tour, Marcelino procured some tequila for us to taste. He explained to us how to properly drink tequila and how not to make what he dubs the ‚Äútequila face‚Äù. Marcelino is going to change your life when he brings out a tequila bottle that contains Damiana, a flower native to that area. The tequila was so good that we spent the rest of the trip scouring for that bottle.Going on this tour was the best idea we made. If I could give this tour more stars, I would.",,,5

533,5 years ago,"We had an absolute blast at this location with this company. Let me start by saying that we are certified scuba divers. We purchased a two-tank dive for $100. Since we have advanced diving certifications we received a private tour with our dive Master dive instructor Liz. She was fantastic. The photographer was pretty amazing as well. He is also a divemaster and dive instructor. We got to dive in the arches and through a canyon, covering both the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific Ocean all-in-one dive. If that wasn't enough, we had sea lions playing around us and then a whale shark circled us. Several times. It was absolutely amazing. And on the final part of the dive we had a wreck and we were able to look at. Truly the best dive ever. Not to mention puffer fish, trumpet fish, urchins, sea snake, octopus, and dozens of other types of fish. The photographer took pictures of all of this and it is a great memory for us. The second dive was quite nice. We saw a lot of the same items even though we dove in a different area.",,,5

545,a year ago,"Our experience with Cabo Adventures couldn‚Äôt have been better! Our excursion to swim with Whale sharks was incredible and we would recommend it to anyone. Our tour guide, Michele and bus driver, Alfredo couldn‚Äôt have made the day any more enjoyable than they already did. Michele‚Äôs extroverted pepiness really gave the trip life (even in the wee hours of the morning it began). Alfredo‚Äôs incredible driving got us everywhere on time and his crazy parking skills can‚Äôt be outdone.The day begins at the marina, meeting your tour guide and the rest of the group. Our group overall was relatively large, so we had a larger tour bus drive us up to La Paz. The drive is pretty long, but it gives you a little time to eat a snack and learn about the whale sharks as well as the various do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts.When you arrive you‚Äôre divvy‚Äôd into groups and assigned a boat guide, ours was Joe. This is the guide responsible for the seafaring portion of your adventure. From there you get your wet suit on and head out to your boat.In the boats you head out to the whale sharks. The boat guide and boat driver do an incredible job of spotting and maneuvering around the sharks within the reserve. Once spotted and in position, a group of 3-4 of you get ready and hop into the water. From there, your boat guide promptly arranges you and you begin swimming as fast as you can. The shark will quickly catch up with you, so do swim as fast as you can! You will only be capable of swimming alongside the shark for a minute or two before you‚Äôre either outrun or lose breath. Taking cameras and extra gadgets in the water can definitely affect your swimming speed. From there you‚Äôre picked up by the boat and given a second to catch your breath as the other group jumps into the water. From there your two groups trade on and off in the water until you run out of time or can‚Äôt go in any longer. Your time with the sharks is somewhat short just because of their speed, so take in every moment as much as you can!Afterwards we were served some fish tacos for lunch and made some various stops on the journey back to Cabo San Lucas.The whole trip was unbelievably amazing, driven by the incredible crew that we had. This trip was undeniably worth the price and I would definitely do it again!

My biggest issue comes from the photo packages they sell as part of the experience.The lowest package was almost $300 USD. It only goes up from there. If you do buy the digital package they just airdrop them to your phone. I mean I guess that makes sense as who uses CDs, but at the same time it felt like they‚Äôre over charging.

We were in Cabo a few weeks ago on a cruise and when we went to Cabo Adventures the lady that worked with us was amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better experience, honestly. My youngest son is Autistic and was having nearly every one of his triggers hit by the experience. She made consistent accommodations to include him without halting the experience for anyone else. She continuously tried to include him without ever pressuring him. It was truly heartwarming to see how he warmed up by the end of it and see him emerged in the pool with the rest of us, giggling away. The pictures were worth a thousand words and more in this case. I was also incredibly grateful for the pictures. They are expensive but honestly it is so amazing to have hundreds of pictures of every moment my boys had playing with their grandparents and dolphins.  It was phenomenal.Also, the flight experience was so much fun and the two gentlemen that helped us for that were so fun and very very kind to me and my family and made accommodations for some of us where mobility was more difficult.",7 months ago,Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience at Cabo Adventures!

We were a little bummed at the cruise ship and didn't mention that they're renovating their pool Splash Zone water slide area, but the company made up for it and made our trip very enjoyable. I'm actually looking forward to going back when they open up the water slide area because it looks really cool, and it's huge. Everybody was very professional and knowledgeable, especially when we went on the Exotic Animal tour. My daughter was super excited to pet the bunnies and see the monkey. Me and the wife decided to ride the RZR Polaris 900 CC utv Vehicles which went very fast and after we rode those we ended up getting on the ATVs and riding them all the way down to the beach on the beach sand where one of our tour guides named mykey with a y. It was very enjoyable getting to ride the camels that they have over there because I've never done that before in my life.

627,a year ago,"Highly recommend this company and their Whale Shark tour!  Well organized company.  My pickup from the hotel was early, leaving me lots of time at the Cabo Adventures facility in CSL to have a coffee and enjoy the attentions of the dolphins in their aquarium (who seemed even more interested in the people than we were in them, if that‚Äôs possible).The trip to La Paz was about 2 hours in a comfortable bus.  Michelle our (very energetic even on just one cup of coffee üòÅ) guide gave a good briefing on the whale shark experience and shared some of her clearly voluminous knowledge about these lovely animals. Scenery was nice, but eventually cactus after cactus got repetitive and I dozed off.At the marina in LP, they company was well organized, distributed wetsuits and snorkelling gear and then we were off to the boats.  Our ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù was Jorge and our dive guide was Mario.  Mario gave a thorough explanation of how the process would unfold, what the rules were and how to maximize our experience.The ride out to the sanctuary took a fair bit of time, but we only waited about 5 mins before we were ‚Äúcleared in‚Äù to start looking for the whale sharks.I had presumed this would be a ‚Äúmaybe you see one, maybe you don‚Äôt‚Äù sort of tour, but was completely wrong.  We were able to locate and swim with, by my count, six different sharks ranging in size from 20ft up to 45 ft.  Everyone got 3 ‚Äújumps‚Äù in, each of which was about 10 mins in total.Mario got lots of video and photos with a GoPro which was available (for a $50 cost) after the dive.  If you have access to an underwater camera, particularly a 360 camera, I‚Äôd highly recommend bringing your own as well.  You don‚Äôt really ‚Äúdive‚Äù, so no need for something waterproof to 30m or anything.Had a nice lunch of tacos at the marina afterwards and then a (much quieter) 2 hour trip back to CSL.  Most people slept the whole way back.The tour is sort of pricey, but it‚Äôs a full day event and (IMO) well worth it!",a year ago,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about Cabo Adventures.

629,3 years ago,"I did multiple activities with Cabo Adventures set up by the all inclusive resort I stayed at while in Los Cabos. I did the luxury sailing experience which included drinks, food, snorkeling, and paddleboarding. Our photographer captured great pictures.

Ziplining was awesome! Ladis, Miguel, Evaristo (Uncle Wayne), Dioney, Mariano, & Pamela or Fabiola(our photographer- might have her name wrong) were great. I'm missing a few names from our tour, but they were all funny and kept us safe. The ziplines weren't the best that I've ever been on. Their process is different for riding, which I enjoyed. The pendulum swing, propelling 98ft down rocks, and the superman line at the end were my favorite. Pics and videos were great.

That is until it was time for tips and I unfortunately realized I had forgotten to bring cash off the cruise ship. Carlos the ship captain went around from person to person with his ""happy hat"" as he called it and when he got to us and I declined to put money in due to forgetting my cash, his demeanor instantly became cold and he began ignoring all my questions. Super disappointing and a poor way to treat paying customers. Just because I did not have an extra few bucks on me for a tip, I STILL paid about 250 for me and my husband to go on the excursion in the first place.

643,5 months ago,"Overall a poor experience we chose a Photo Whale Watching experience assuming the skipper would choose to get the boat as close as legally permitted with no other boats in the way on this he failed repeatedly, even when the whales appeared outside of the other boats close to use within 2 minutes we were at the back.The additional issue was the constant inane chatter from Karla the guide it never stopped throughout. We spent over 30 minutes of the tour getting out to open sea whilst some of this was due to harbour restrictions the vast majority was trying to show us amongst the other boats the arch and beaches which whilst pretty wasn‚Äôt the point of the tour.Once at sea we did see whales but the majority of the time with the sun in our face making photographs all very prone to becoming silhouettes. No drinks were offered throughout the tour although supposedly included.To top it all off when we did have whales close by few other boats and positioned well for photos we were pulled away as we needed to listen to a hydrophone that heard nothing so a recording was played losing time with the whales we returned to the dock approx 20 mins earlier than had been suggested for the tour.",,,1

671,5 months ago,We did the Dolphin Family Encounter experience and the experience itself was wonderful. It was $468USD for a 20 minute experience for 2 adults and 4 kids. Why I give this only 1 star was because this company criminally attempts to exploit your desire to capture the memories. They don't allow you to bring a camera during the experience which we were ok with because we were going to buy the pictures. Well after the experience we go to buy the pictures and the cheapest option we are presented with is $519USD for all the pictures with no cheaper option. We left with no pictures and an experience so poor it completely ruined my memory of the excursion. Shame on this company for these tactics!!!,5 months ago,"We appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to discuss your experience with us.

732,5 years ago,ü¶à I absolutely recommend this experience. We took our daughters and they loved it. The dolphins were so cute and trained so well. They looked very well taken care of by the trainers. The only down side to this experience is the cost of the pictures. Basic package was around $150 up to over $250. NO INDIVIDUAL PHOTOS. That being said the photos were great. üì∏üéû #LocalGuides,,,4
733,5 years ago,"Great tour company with wide variety of offerings.  We did the snorkeling trip which goes to Chileno Bay.  Snorkeling is fair and not a full active reef, but it is nice to have a variety of SUP, kayak, swimming, and snorkeling options and time on your own.  Plus a good boat ride past El Arco, and even saw some whales too.  Tour guides are enthusiastic, geared to tourists and service-oriented, genuinely seem to like their jobs.Whale watching tour was lucky to see many humpbacks including two breaching side-by-side.  Guides were great and would highly recommend either of these for families and all ages.Parking is free on north side of the dolphin building if spots are open.",,,5

Dylan provided great knowledge of the local history and geography of the area and captain Miguel kept us protected on the crazy waves! We did snorkeling and some kayaking. The fish were gorgeous! Watch out for some of the small jellyfish‚Ä¶they do sting. Our tour guides gave us some vinegar and cream for the spots where we got stung and it reduced the pain significantly. Great trip overall minus my tid bit of seasickness. We got a yummy snack at the end as well!

740,5 months ago,"It looks like this company does scam! Booked a sunset cruise for January'23  in November 2022. While I was booking it online, my CCard # got stolen and someone started using it. Not a problem, noticed it immediately, changed the card. Then we come for a cruise, they say ""the CCard must be presented by a person who made a booking"". So, here I am, with my credit card. They told me that the card is different (last 4 digits). They didn't care that it is me, my name, my booking, same account. They told me that they have to cancel that payment and I need to make another one, they'll make a refund on November payment right away. OK, no problem, I paid again. The only difference that this time they charged me 11 dollars more for the same thing. And also, they didn't refund me my money. They refunded them in two weeks. 11 dollars less. The entire thing is very suspicious - I called them they refused to refund me the difference. Disputing the charge now. There are another companies doing the same cruises. Don't deal with this one - they are scammers.",,,1

744,6 months ago,"We did two tours through Cabo Adventures are SO glad we did! We booked the Luxury Sunset Sail and the Luxury Two-Bay Snorkel. Both blew us away.The transportation was so easy and the drivers were very kind. On our sail, we had a crew of Emmanuel, Bruno, and Lynette. The boat took us in close around the arch and point out to the pacific ocean where we watched the sunset. We saw two whales and took some time with them as well. The food and drinks were great. If you've never been sailing before, be warned that it can be bumpy on a sailboat so be prepared if you are prone to motion sickness (not an issue for us, but a few others on the trip were having a tough time).Our crew for the snorkel was Jacob, Johnny, Vianet, Edgar, and Daniel. We were on a beautiful catamaran and again went out for a quick look at the arch, then sailed over to Chileno Bay. Again saw a whale on the way! Jacob was so knowledgable and I learned a lot about the local wildlife from him. We stopped for snorkeling in two spots within Chileno Bay - one on each side of a reef. I was hoping wetsuits would be provided (December) but the water wasn't too bad without it. It was a chilly on the second snorkel after getting out and back in. We then ate a delicious late lunch and headed back to the marina with a view of the sunset. On the way, we encountered a group of thousands of endangered spiny devil rays (mobulas) all jumping out of the water around the boat. Truly magical!Both tours exceeded our expectations and we look forward to booking more with them when we (hopefully) return to Cabo one day!",6 months ago,Thank you for having taken the time to post your wonderful review of Cabo Adventures and sharing how much you enjoyed both adventures.

805,6 months ago,"Absolutely the best zip tour I've ever done, I need a couple more stars to give!!!I was a season's pass holder for two years at an adventure park, I try to zip and climb everywhere whenever I'm on vacation, and this was a phenomenal experience.Our guides (Joel, Mago, Arturo, Erid, Evaristo, Brandon, and Carlos) were quick, efficient, safe, and super fun from start to finish.  It was like hanging out with all the cool kids, and it felt like they were genuinely enjoying their jobs and they took amazing care of us all day.The upside down and Superman zips were glorious, and I loved the additional cable element, rock climbing wall, rappelling, and light bouldering that really made this tour stand out.The lunch was lovely, it's a gorgeous location, and they have a wonderful staff all the way across the board.  This is the only place where I've ever bought the photo package - the photographer was very professional and amazing at getting fantastic action shots and posed snaps for the memories.

861,6 months ago,"This is our 3rd time doing the Dolphin Encounter at Cabo Adventures and either things have really changed to worse or it is just our bad luck with the bad experience and terrible customer service we had this time.Paying over $300 for two kids and being put with a large family of 5 adults was just the start of a disaster. My little ones hardly had a chance to ‚Äúbreak the ice‚Äù or get comfortable in the water‚Ä¶ It was super rushed for the kids with very little consideration to their age or comfort.With respect to staff there, I think the tips mentality is very dominant and really distract the trainers from doing their job properly and equally but they focus on pleasing the participating adults more. ü§ëWhat made the experience even worse was when we went to the studio to look at the ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù pictures/videos taken‚Ä¶ hardly any good pictures of the kids compared to the past, most of the kids pictures were with the other family covering the kids and the individual pictures are either rushed or poorly taken. Of course for the package price is EXAGGERATED - asking $365 USD for 5 clips of 1 to 6 seconds long and mostly of the big adult family in them.. We politely but disappointedly refused but we were followed outside by a nice staff Brenda offering us 40% off.It was still not worth it for us because there were literally 3 pictures that we wanted, Brenda suggested that she would talk to her supervisor and see what she can do‚Ä¶ When the ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù Diana Mtz came out, she was VERY rude, unprofessional and with a nasty nasty attitude. She did not greet us at and all she said  was YES!? and left us explaining the situation from the beginning with zero empathy as if her team didn‚Äôt tell her anything.Maybe she was not happy that her team distracted her from being on her phone or she naturally carries the cunning, rude attitude with her all the time‚Ä¶ I just hope the team around her are not learning her rudeness. Basically she said that‚Äôs all we have for you, take it or leave it.I am sure the young and kind photographer did his best even though it was not at the level of the price.All I have to say that, it was a waste of time and money for us today + the worse customer experience we had in our life from a person who should be leading by a good example to a team.Hasta Nunca!!",,,1

895,10 months ago,"We did the camels and the dolphins and were disappointed with both. Keep in mind you can not take phones or photos.The dolphins... no one should ever leave this excursion in tears like I did!! I finally fulfilled my lifelong dream of swimming with a dolphin only to walk away with no picture to keep the memory.  The cheapest package was $330USD for a group of 3 of us. The pictures were almost as much as the excursion!! They do not allow single photo purchases at this site and we only liked maybe 5 or 6 of the photos.  The lunch was a dried up tortilla with some cheese inside,  2 small spoonfuls of beans and a spoon of salsa.The camels... the whole excursion including travel time took almost 7.5 hours. We were told the camel ride itself would be 20 minutes,  it lasted 12 minutes.  Lunch was decent but not great.  Photo packages are crazy and I was permitted to buy 1 single photo for $40USD as I did not want any other pictures or videos. The only good part of this excursion was the speedboat at the very beginning.I recommend looking for a different excursion company and checking the guidelines for taking pictures and photo prices and such.",10 months ago,"We appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to discuss your experience with us. The welfare of our dolphins and guest safety during the program is our main priority; for this reason, we do not allow guests to take cameras, cell phones, jewelry or any other article into the dolphin habitat. We provide an optional photo experience and an observation area in which non-swimmers can catch those magical moments.In regards to camels, we would like to clarify that the camel ride has a duration of 25 minutes approximately, starting from the platform where you mount the camel, through the desert, onto the beach and back the same way, this is the ideal time for a camel ride for your own comfort and care of our camels. As you mentioned, cameras and cell phones are not allowed at the ride for safety reasons, guests must be holding on to the saddle with both hands at all times during the ride. The money from the camel ride & photos not only covers for the care, maintenance, and enrichment for our camel family but also allows us to provide you with experienced, professional photographers and the best photography equipment to capture that once-in-a-lifetime moment.We regret to know that our food did not meet your expectations, we will pass along your comment to our team, and we will consider them in the future.From all of us at our team, we thank you again for bringing this situation to our attention and truly hope to welcome you back in the near future.",2
896,a year ago,"We did the Cabo dolphins swim with dolphins experience. Our guide David was so great! He was straight to the point of how to interact with our dolphin, was very funny and extremely accommodating. My mom is unable to swim and he made sure she was still able to have moments with our dolphin so she could still be a part of the experience. Everyone in our group got equal amounts of time to interact and swim with our dolphin. I enjoyed the small group which allowed for a lot of interaction. My only negative is I wish the pictures were cheaper, they definitely get you on the price of those.

Their English was GREAT if that's something you're worried about! (Doesn't matter to me as both my wife and I are bilingual, and also realize we are in *their* country lol.) Not to mention, the guides were very funny and entertaining and helpful!There was an incident worth mentioning... My wife got extremely sea sick on the boat. Franco and Caesar made her a drink that helped, were extremely kind and very accommodating. Unfortunately she ended up throwing up, on the deck of the sailboat no less. They immediately cleaned the mess up and helped clean her up too. They were very understanding and sweet about the whole situation.

929,10 months ago,"I would love to show pictures of this great time I had with my family but I have none because they won't let you take any pictures and their photo packages start at $200. The dolphin experience/encounter itself is already expensive and the whole thing is basically a 30 min-1hr photo shoot to extort money from you at the end because they know you would love to walk away with the visible memory of your child hugging a dolphin. The dolphins seem well taken care of and the trainer/handler Eric was very talented but there is almost no information about them as a species or their care. They're essentially treated like clowns. It was amazing being able to interact with the dolphin but knowing that this experience was essentially pure extortion put such a shade on the entire time. I would've paid for 1 photo for $25 to even $50 dollars I think that would actually make them more money because their sales volume would go up, but throwing down a potential total of $500 for a 30 minute afternoon activity is just ridiculous.",9 months ago,"We appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to discuss your experience with us.

942,5 years ago,"TIP: I used Cabo Adventures for a fly-boarding experience. Although it's advertised with them at $200, you should be able to get it for around $100 by purchasing the activity from using one of the activity consultants located around the marina.CON: Why do the tourist activities in Cabo insist on price gouging customers for the photos! Instead of giving every person a free photo (digital or printed) to celebrate and remember the occasion, they charge ridiculous prices. This practice simply detracts from an otherwise awesome experience.PRO: Staff were friendly, and the fly-boarding experience was great fun.Overall, this could have easily been a 5 star experience, but I despise the way already paying customers are asked to pay ridiculous prices for some photos (which would actually encourage posts on Facebook etc).",,,3

Unfortunately due to inexperience a member of my travel group fell for the massive tourist scam this Adventure Cabo.1. It comes down to ethics & morals. Taking advantage of tourists isn‚Äôt a good look. ‚Äú we‚Äôre comparable to others..‚Äù OTHERS DOING THE SAME THING? Two wrongs do not make a right.2. If you choose to book with this company be prepared to be harassed by the ‚Äúprofessional photographer‚Äù. There are moments of course we would all like captured. Sometimes I want to enjoy the moment without a stranger going ‚Äú look here‚Ä¶ hello‚Ä¶ whistle‚Äù. You can expect to pay $300 USD - $800 USD for faux photographers work. The very basics a professional photographer would know is a) don‚Äôt shoot up your subjects nose. b) do not shoot below eye level. c) don‚Äôt shoot in harsh lighting.- Photos were purchased because  I wanted to accommodate my fellow travelers. However THE PHOTOS WERE AWFUL AND NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. Every one of these basic photography rules were broken.  You also are not allowed to use your personal camera or phone to take a photo at any time. You may not have an additional person take a photo with a cell phone. You can only buy theirs. Believe me it would not have bothered the camel if this photo was from my camera Vs the photographers. Such a scam.3. The food was far from advertised. It was dull without taste. Find a stand on the street for good food after you spend all day wasted here.4. The adventures were exaggerated in advertisements.5. You will waste the entire day driving to the ‚Äúranch‚Äù, standing around, being herded from one wait place to the next, and have about 15 minutes on a camel (really a pony ride for a little kid).",7 months ago,"Thank you for taking the time to share your honest experience with us.

971,9 months ago,"A VERY DECEITFUL COMPANY!Decent experience but do not get injured. My group of friends did the camel and ATV tour. The camel ride was a great experience  but only lasted about 15 minutes. Unfortunately during the ATV ride oneOf my friends fell off the ATV. To start the ATV path is very rocky. A staff member instructed two of our friends to go an alternate route for a more ‚Äúthrilling‚Äù experience. THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. The instructor should have kept the group together . This is where and how my friend got injured. Busted lip , broken collarbone etc. Being from out of the country we were nervous to seek medical treatment in Mexico. Mainly due to the language barrier and not knowing much about the health system. We were going to deny medical service however, Cabo adventure LIED to us. They convinced us that they will take us to the hospital and cover the  medical charges. They stated that the medical charges would have been covered by the $35 dollar insurance that is required when renting the ATV. When we got to the private hospital we were handed a $2k bill. We asked the Cabo adventure rep that drove us to cover the charge. They changed the story saying that they will not cover it. They took my friend to the hospital to cover themselves and left him with the bill. That is horrible because what would have happened if we did not have $2,000 to pay the hospital. When it was time to pay the bill at ST LUKES two hospital security guards came out to show us the cost of medical services. Cabo adventures could have put us in a very bad situation if we did not have the ability to pay. For this reason I would NEVER book with Cabo adventures or any of there affiliated companies. They are DECEITFUL and they only care about themselves.",,,1

The other things we did (Eco Farm, Tequila tasting, Lunch) were nice, but again, quite touristy.  I suppose if you really want to ride camels and don‚Äôt expect to have another opportunity it may be worth it, but it‚Äôs not like camels are native to Mexico.  So, it felt more like riding an elephant in the U.S.Also, you can quickly come close to doubling your expected cost by visiting the facility.  $20/pp to enter the park.  $85 if you want the digital photos.  $39/ea if you want a print.Again, nice experience, but super touristy.",a year ago,"Thank you for taking the time to write your honest review about your experience with us, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.The camel ride has a duration of 25 minutes approximately, starting from the platform where you mount the camel, through the desert, onto the beach and back the same way, this is the ideal time for a camel ride for your own comfort and care of our camels.Regarding the pictures, the money from the camel ride & photos not only covers for the care, maintenance, and enrichment for our camel family but also allows us to provide you with experienced, professional photographers and the best photography equipment to capture that once-in-a-lifetime moment.We regret that you did not enjoy our educational and informative eco-workshops at Ecofarm, we work hard every day to offer interesting facts and share the actions we take as a company in favor of sustainability, conservation and community support programs.

It was amazing to see how well trained this dolphin was. We had a blast, and I‚Äôm still thinking about the experience hours later. The reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars is because there‚Äôs no way to buy just one or two pictures. You have to pay $240 for all the pictures they took when over half of them weren‚Äôt even good shots. That‚Äôs the CHEAPEST package too. So we didn‚Äôt get pictures of us with the dolphins, and it is a bummer because we‚Äôre on our honeymoon. You already pay over $300 for this experience, you should be allowed to buy at least ONE individual picture or a small picture should be included!",a year ago,"Thank you for taking the time to share your honest experience with us.

The photographer did and excellent job getting photos and videos of our experience. But he prepared to pay a fortune for the photos. Like wedding photos cost!!! Approximately $100 per person.

The catamaran was a better choice to go out into the sea- options to lie in front, sitting area aft and another area on top around the captain. The crew ( guide, photographer and chef) were amazing.

The camel ride was only 30 mins and they would not allow us to take pics while riding the camels because of safety reasons. The real reason was because they wanted to sell us a photo package that cost $300 dls. It was ridiculous. On top of that there is a park entrance fee of $20 dls. per person. Cabo adv, owns the ranch and provide the service. I don't understand why they charge to enter. Nevertheless, this was my 1st time to Los Cabos.

Ziplining, hiking, rock climbing, rappelling, and ending off with the Superman zipline was amazing! Our tour guides were perfect. They let us take our time if we needed to, and helped out a lot when needed. I had some difficulties, but luckily I was able to be one of the last ones to go on some, because I was a scaredy baby! Overall loved this tour, and will book with them again in the future!About the photo prices, I can assure to anyone concerned that they are NOT ROBBING YOU of your money. I work for a photo company in Las Vegas and they charge a lot more for everything, and they don't allow personal photos as well. With Cabo Adventures, they want you to have your memories and experience, not with a phone or camera in front of your face. Having a photographer there with you, catching candid moments, posed photos, etc, is what is so great about it! We paid $154 for a metal print, 2 photo prints, a book with all our photos, and all the digitals! I love photos, and this price was worth it. Better than getting 6 printed photos for $147 in Vegas, that's for sure!

1068,a year ago,"My wife and I did the dolphin encounter which was amazing and totally recommend over any other dolphin excursion.  HOWEVER, be prepared for the tourist trap and scam that is pulled at the end.   On top of the cost for the encounter, the cheapest photo package, yes package, you cannot buy just a couple photos-you must buy a package; was $240 and that was the lowest going up from there.  Total rip off for digital images and left a sour taste in our mouth hence the 1 star review.  I'm sure their reply will be their side of the story but I can tell you there is a reason no cell phones are allowed inside.  Would have been totally satisfied with a $50 or even $100 photo deal but $240 is a bunch of bull.",a year ago,"We appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to discuss your experience with us.

Our dolphin's name was something like ""Marai."" She was adorable. My only disappointment was with the fact that she cruised while taking us on a swim. The other dolphins in the pool with other groups swam like speedboats, so I couldn't help but feel like I was missing out on some fun. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.",a year ago,Thank you for your comments regarding your experience.

1073,3 years ago,"We took a tour to the island of Espiritu Santo, which was wonderful. They picked us up from San Jose del Cabo and from the San Lucas dolphinarium. We all left together for La Paz (it's about a 2-hour drive), I recommend having breakfast before going because there are a lunch until 11:00 or so when you arrive at the catamaran they give you fruit, yogurt, bread and juice, the road is slow so you can enjoy the scenery and drinks. They go directly to the island of the sea lions where you swim for about 30 minutes with them, it's a very cool experience because they pass close to you and you can almost touch them. If you don't know how to swim very well, there are some guys who help my parents. the whole process (thank you), you can only swim with them in a certain season of the year, it seems to me that from September to February but I'm not sure, after that they give you the food which is very tasty, they are sandwiches, pasta and guacamole if they are good quantities, after lunch we stopped at another spot where we could swim and we spent a while there and then we returned to the port, I don't know if it was because of the time we went where the water was very cold that we spent more time in the tacamaran than in the water, for which I think it is a very good option if you want to do something relaxing, it is not tiring so older people can go the catamaran always goes at a very adequate speed, in general everything was more than perfect the attention was always appropriate, it is highly recommended to take this tour with them.",,,5

1082,a year ago,"I‚Äôm only leaving a one star review because I am utterly heartbroken that after the 40 min experience at hundreds of dollars‚Ä¶ We were told at the very end they have no options to just buy a single photo or a couple‚Ä¶ so you get NOTHING to remember it. Because the photos at the bare minimum are $250. As a signed model and actress with an agency that is absolutely insane to pay for 30minutes of photos. There were no other options to get a single picture so as stated we left heartbroken and feeling like such a special experience was just completely ruined because we can‚Äôt even see a pic of it to show our children later on. Or ourselves to look back on. I loved our instructor he was amazing- and the dolphin Nakai.. but had we known we weren‚Äôt able to bring a phone up to take our own pics and then would be forced to leave with nothing because of the OUTRAGEOUS price.. we would have never booked with them. Please be aware. Even if you are well off, even if you have money- you‚Äôre not going to make it out of here without dropping at least 600$. There should be a warning about this beforehand. Very disappointed and more sad that the one thing I wanted to do on my Mother‚Äôs Day trip was a scammed and very low ball move on this company‚Äôs end with their photo buying requirements.I truly believe y‚Äôall can do better.

1120,9 months ago,"This company is sleek and well run. The location in Cabo San Lucas is beautiful and everyone who works there is professional and kind. It had a nice area to eat lunch before our excursion and had clean, free bathrooms, which is hard to find in the marina area.So why the three stars? We had went on the camel, arches, and eco farm trip. Although staff was friendly, the eco farm had really strict rules that made it hard to enjoy our excursion. They do not let you take ANY personal pictures of the camels and instead have a team of photographers taking pictures of the trek and of individual interactions with the camels. Not a big deal, but then they have the audactity to charge $90pp for copies of digital pictures! And that is the cheapest package they offer. (You cannot just order one print.) It was rather disappointing when they don't let you take any personal pictures. Also, the eco farm is a good hour away from the marina, which you should be aware of. Our four hour trip was actually a six hour trip with traffic and wait times. I also wished that we were able to walk around the farm on our own and see the different elements like the rescued animals, but everyone was strict in the areas we had to stay as a group. The only part of the eco farm that we were able to hear about was the cacao. (We didn't get to hear about the Oh Sheet paper or visit the farm with rescued animals. The $20 entrance fee seems kind of rediculous when you don't even get to experience half of what the farm has.)Cabo Adventures is definitely a sleek and well run company, but I think that these issues need to be addressed before giving it a higher score.",9 months ago,"Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience with us, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.For safety reasons, the use of cameras, Gopros, or any type of phone is not allowed during the ride, you can use your equipment in the rest of the activities such as the Ecofarm, the desert walk, and the restaurant.

1123,8 months ago,"Very impressed! My wife and I went to San Jose del Cabo for our 10 year anniversary and decided to try out three activities with Cabo Adventures: Sailing, ATVs, and Zip lining.All three activities were great, but we loved the ATVs and Zip lining. With the ATVs we got wet and the ride was a bit over 2 hours. Afterwards, we went to eat at their buffet and the food was very delicious. They then later invited us their special tequila, Damiana and some Tequila reposado. It was quite the experience. Our host, Vic, did in awesome job and made sure we had a great time.The zip lining was another experience for the books! Not only did we zip line, but we also rapelled and rock climbed. Neither my husband or I have done rapel or rock climbed, but our guides did an awesome job explaining on how to do it and were there the whole time to ensure we were safe. Jonathan and his team made us feel safe the whole time and were excellent guides. They were very respectful and made us laugh the whole time. This experience was about three hours. Our favorite zip line was the superman/Wonder Woman!

1129,a year ago,"I would love to say that I had and amazing time on this tour but I didn‚Äôt. I booked this excursion as a birthday surprise for my friend during our stay in Los Cabos. All in all it was beautiful in the beginning. The group was dry and boring so we tried talking and making jokes with the instructor with hopes of loosening everyone up, that barely worked. The drinks and the light snack with lunch was cool. We docked near a beach and my friend and I relaxed aboard while everyone else swam, snorkeled, or did the paddle boarding activity. As we are on our way back, the instructor ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù us and says hey now we‚Äôre going sailing. I‚Äôve never experienced sailing so I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but I would have said no had they explained or prepared us for what was next.Soon enough the boat began to tilt HEAVILY. My friend and I are literally sliding off the side of the boat. I was honestly so scared to fall in. I had on a dress and it was super slippery. No railing on the side of the boat just us and the water. No life vests were provided. The couple in front of us knew what was coming so they moved all the way to the back before this activity began. Not one of the instructors warned us or mentioned to us to sit in the back if we were uncomfortable with the activity. Next thing you know the captain hits a gigantic wave and my friend and I are all soaking wet. At this point I honestly felt myself about to slide off the boat and into the water. I had on light make up, contacts so I could wear my sunglasses, and also had an eyelash set done before coming. I was extremely upset to have gotten splashed in my face like this with sea salt.A woman on the other side told the tour guide she could clearly see we were not enjoying this and maybe they should stop. The captain proceeded to continue sailing. It was overall a horrible experience.For everyone on the boat to have gotten in the water and we didn‚Äôt, you would think ""hey maybe they didn‚Äôt plan on getting wet today."" I feel it was horribly thought through. I would never in my life board a boat again, I am extremely traumatized.",a year ago,"Dear Fran'cheska B,

We are sorry to read that your experience didnít meet your expectations. We try to provide our guests a real sailing experience as this is the main highlight of the experience you booked and most of the time it is very enjoyable and adventurous. Although the real adventure is in the front of the boat, we provide shade and seats in the back where the movement of the sailboat feels smoother. We also have other tours like the two-bay snorkel in catamaran for people who prefer a calmer experience. We can also arrange customized private charters to suit your needs and have an additional services catalogue to complement your experience.

We welcome all comments since they help us learn and improve, so please rest assured your valuable feedback has been taken into consideration.

1149,10 months ago,"We took two tours with Cabo Adventures in August of 2022. I wanna share both because I feel like they were a different experience.The luxury snorkeling tour was a bit of a miss for us. Was super excited to go on a sailboat for the first time, but they had the sails up for like 5 minutes only for photos. If I had known that I probably would have booked us the two bay catamaran because at least it‚Äôs more time snorkeling. Also, when we got there it was a free for all. The crew just gave us gear and that‚Äôs it. No information on where to go to snorkel or a guide on the water. It seemed like it was ALLL about the photos. Listen, I get they have a job to do. But not everyone has $100 for a photo when I could take it on my phone. If I want one I‚Äôll ask, but at the arch I asked someone to take a photo for us and the photographer said she needs the spot to take photos. Just pretty rude we already spend a lot for the tour I just wanted to take a photo for probably 10 seconds.The second tour we did, Sea of Cortez in La Paz was AMAZING. The crew (led the Diego who was incredible) made the day so fun. Breakfast and lunch were honestly a good portion, kept drinks flowing after the snorkel and really cared about us and the experience. They guided us into the reef and helped find octopus and other amazing marine life. They showed everyone how to use the gear and really went above and beyond to make everyone comfortable and have fun. This is the one I‚Äôd say do not miss! Also they were as aggressive about us using our own phones and GoPro for photos or pressuring about buying them.All in all, the company was professional and has some great excursions I just wouldn‚Äôt say the luxury snorkel is worth it in my opinion, unless it was the crew we had.",10 months ago,"Thank you for your comments, we are happy to read you had a great time and will pass along your comments to our team members.

1156,3 years ago,"About the camel ride....Within the ""3 hrs"" of travel, consider that the transfer is 1 hr until you reach the ranch, their main business is photography, since they are prohibited for your ""security"",?? they leave more expensive than the same tour. The time of the explanation about the ""desert"" plants is excessive and they do not offer anything to hydrate you during it, the time of the camel ride is very short (10 min), the buffet food is not that good, the salvageable thing is the very friendly guides... I give this rating for the experience but I will not return, I RECOMMEND that if you take this tour you take a Go pro with helmet support to record your tour because for this they do not make an excuse about ""safety"" ",,,3

We booked this excursion through our Disney Cruise; known through DCL as Cabo Canyon Adventure (CL21). The men who were in charge of our group were Ladis, Arturo, and Carlos; Mike took all of our photos and videos. I can't stop raving about how GREAT and FUN and FRIENDLY and WONDERFUL these men were! All the while, SAFETY was FIRST!!! Even though we had a LOT of fun!!! Safety was first! We did so many ziplines, a rope climb, a rock wall climb, and rappelling straight down a tree! We even got to zipline upside down .. TWICE! These guys were GREAT!!!! and the pictures Mike took were WONDERFUL!!! The only down part to this excursion was that it is a bit of a ride in the van (about 75 minutes) to get to the canyon. But, it was DEFINITELY worth it! After the adventure was completed, we were able to sit down to a very tasty meal of handmade tortillas, grilled veggies, beans, guacamole, cheese, and more; no meat, but it wasn't needed because the food was very good and filling! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this excursion! One very important item, bring a credit card to purchase photos/videos after the adventure is done. We forgot but Mike gave us all the info we needed to purchase the photo & video package when we got home. These guys are GREAT!! I can't speak highly enough of this excursion!",8 months ago,"Thank you for your amazing review and comments, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.We can't wait to see you again and create more fun memories!Hasta Pronto!",5

1164,a year ago,"My husband and I went at the beginning of February to enjoy a Camel tour at Cabo Adventures. While the Eco-Farm tour was nice, we felt that the entire trip was a bit of a captured-audience cash-grab.The tour itself cost $75/each plus an additional $20 to enter the farm. We hope that our money really does go back into conservation but I'd have to guess that most of it does not. Especially given that they are proudly touring their recycled materials equipment yet not one single thing on campus was made from recycled materials.The worst part was the Camel ""tour."" The whole excursion took up an entire day (10 a.m.-6 p.m.) but we rode Camels for ONLY 15 minutes. The worst part is how strict they were about our taking photos. As soon as we headed over to the camel area they demanded our photos/phones were put away then FORCED a ""photo-shoot"" with their on-site staff. Then, they packaged images for $65+ depending on what you wanted to purchase. As a hobby photographer, this was extremely disappointing. I understand not wanting us to use our phones/cameras while ""riding"" (though, it really felt more like a pony ride for a 3 year old than an actual ride). They also required us to wear headscarves over our helmets and it felt, in a way, like we were appropriating Arabic culture.This  portion of the tour would be good for a family with younger children but not adults.  We were super bored.I will say the tour guides were lovely and the food at the end was pretty good.  All in all, we were disappointed we wasted the entire day on this tour.",a year ago,"Dear BryerThank you for taking the time to write your experience with us, we welcome all comments since they help us learn and improve.We would like to clarify that the camel ride has a duration of 25 minutes approximately, starting from the platform where you mount the camel, through the desert, onto the beach, and back the same way, this is the ideal time for a camel ride for your own comfort and care of our camels.The safety of our guests is our top priority, and for this reason, we provide a helmet during the ride, the headscarves are completely optional and if you wish not to use them, you are free to take them out. As you mentioned, for safety reasons, the use of cameras, Gopros, or any type of phone is not allowed during the ride, you can use your equipment in the rest of the activities such as the Ecofarm, the desert walk, and the restaurant. We offer an optional photoshoot session with our professional photographers so you can get the best memories with our camel family.Regarding the cost of the pictures, we stand behind our rates, as the staff that captures, processes, and sells them is highly qualified, also the photos and videos are delivered with professional quality.We regret that you did not enjoy our educational and informative eco-workshops at Ecofarm, we work hard every day to offer interesting facts and share the actions we take as a company in favor of sustainability, conservation and community support programs.

1177,a year ago,"We did 2 excursions with Cabo Adventures during our time there. The first was the snorkeling trip with Richie and the second was the sunset cruise with Jesus and Edgar. If you don‚Äôt like rough waters, we would caution you to go.The snorkeling trip was so much fun! We took a speedboat and Richie was sure to point out all of the sights and get photos of us. The snorkeling spot he took us to was breathtaking. The water is so clear and there are so many different colorful fish! He pointed out the different kinds, and he let us free dive when we had some time left. With the speed of the boat and the rough waters in Cabo, it was definitely choppy. Overall, Richie and the snorkeling trip were a lot of fun.The sunset cruise was also very nice and relaxing. Even on the sailboat though, the choppy waters were enough to cause the boat to move around a lot - if you get seasick easily we don‚Äôt recommend it. Jesus and Edgar were funny and personable and they were sure to take lots of pictures of us. The food they serve on the trip isn‚Äôt the best, but the drinks are great! The photos they take on their cameras are very expensive to buy, we recommend having someone take photos of you on your personal camera. It was a beautiful trip though!Our only complaint with Cabo Adventures is that all of the excursions are run out of the same place, and they don‚Äôt really give you much information when you get there. They required us to get there an hour before our time slot in case of lines from people with other excursions. We got back from our snorkeling trip at 3:10pm to find out that the next shuttle bus didn‚Äôt leave until 4pm. It definitely took up the whole day which was a bit of a bummer. We only chose them as they worked with our hotel and our hotel ran a promo to get the excursions at 25% the cost, otherwise we probably would have looked into other one off places.",a year ago,"Thank you for your comments, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.We are sorry to know you did not enjoy our transportation service, our team works very hard everyday to plan the logistics of moving hundreds of people everyday and we are doing improvements to offer a quick and efficient service for all our guests.

1182,10 months ago,"This group has a strong presence in Cabo.  The problem with the business is the logistics of transporting customers from their respective resorts to the many  adventure locations in Cabo.  For example, my family was scheduled for ATV rides.  We were picked up from our resort and transported to the dolphin venue (20 minutes the wrong direction for ATVs).  Once at the dolphin facility, we were put on another shuttle that was for the ATV ride - now an hour away!  The total ride to the facility is now a full hour.  So, before we even got the chance for riding ATVs, we wasted an hour and a half of valuable vacation time.This is poor logistics and equally poor customer service.

Swimming with these endangered Whale Sharks was simply amazing. They‚Äôre magnificent animals and it was incredible to see them in their natural habitat just doing their thing. Our driver Leo had us there and back smoothly and efficiently. Michelle was a wealth of information, knowledge and good humor, and if we could figure out a way to pack her safely we‚Äôd have gladly taken her back to New York with us, but we knew she‚Äôd hate the weather at this time of the year!  Michelle‚Äôs depth of knowledge was endless and her delivery was amazing!  Capt Yayo and David the dive master were a fantastic team who did an incredible job getting us to where we could really see the Whale Sharks and interact safely with them so as to not disturb them and so we could enjoy our encounters‚Ä¶‚Ä¶yes, plural‚Ä¶..they found quite a few of them for us to swim with and watch.

1205,4 years ago,"Okay experience. I think I expected more because of the price. It isn't cheap. However, the facility was nice, was well ran, clean, had a bar, coffee stand and gift shop.  But I paid for my kid and I to swim with the dolphins and that didn't really happen.During the experience the trainer rushed everyone through their encounter, kept forgetting who had done what part already, and when it came time for my daughter to swim with the dolphin, the dolphin started to pull her under so they had her let go. That part is understandable since they are animals and unpredictable, but then my daughter never got a chance to swim with the dolphin? I was pretty disappointed. I didn't push it since at that point my daughter was a little scared but I would expect a professional trainer to recognize these situations and be prepared to encourage the guests.Also, the only option for having a photo of the experience is from their photographer, which is fine but there were only 3 photos and the video that I wanted... There was only 2 of us so there wasn't many photos. But they wouldn't let me just purchase individual photos, I was required to buy an entire 'package' for over $200...

1225,8 months ago,"I bought the Deluxe Snorkel package in two bays as a gift for my parents and my sister. Everything was going well, from the payment for the platform, the telephone service and the responses by email. The problem was the experience... they arrived happy for the places they visited and the catamaran, but we are compatriots, that is, Mexicans... my father did not go down to snorkel but my sister and my mother did, without being explained and/or helped one once being downstairs, unlike the foreigners to whom they explained and helped... Regarding the all-inclusive beverage service, they had to ask 4 times for a glass of water, needless to say that foreigners were served immediately.

I decided to buy with them, which are also the most expensive of the tourist offer, because I thought that I was also buying an excellent service, but unfortunately we are Mexicans and it seems that our money is not worth it.

My recommendation is that if you are Mexican, do not buy with them, they prefer to serve foreigners to receive tips in dollars.",8 months ago,"Dear Paulette

1252,10 months ago,"COMPLETE SCAM
If you don't want to feel ripped off, don't even think about booking the camel tour in the Holy Land.
The price is very high for what they offer you.
First of all, they show you some macaws and you have to wait about an hour for everyone to take pictures with them (that's what this activity consists of).
Then they show you a camel (incredible, a show, everything must be said), but they don't allow you to take photos with your mobile. There's no other reason than the business they're running trying to charge you $40 for a photo or $80 for the basic photo package. I could understand the prohibition during the camel ride, but when you are posing standing up with the camel, there is no problem at all. In fact, other people on the tour took photos of me and the person from the organization who took the official photos told me that he was going to kick me out of the tour if I took just one photo. Very rude and with very bad manners.
The camel ride is fine, but if you want to have some souvenirs, add $80 to the price of the tour.
It is totally abusive and a shame that they take advantage of tourists like this. 0% recommended.",9 months ago,"Dear Navy

1304,a year ago,"We went on the Luxury Sailing tour and I cannot express how much fun we had with Erick and Charly!  It was honestly the highlight of the trip.  The tour included snacks, open bar, lunch, paddle boarding, and snorkeling.  We loved having a photographer on board as well to capture all of the moments that we would not have thought to snap a picture of at the time.The pick-up from the hotel was seamless and the check in was fast and easy.  It was seriously such a great time that we considered signing up for another tour if there wasn't forecast for bad weather in the upcoming days.I can't recommend this enough! I will be telling everyone who is traveling to Cabo to take this tour!!",a year ago,Hi Kayla!Thank you for having taken the time to post your wonderful review of Cabo Adventures and sharing how much you enjoyed our Luxury Day Sailing.

1307,10 months ago,"We bought the camel experience. The truth is that the experience is not bad, it is quite good and the food too, the guides are very friendly.

Butoooooo!!!!! What really made us leave with a very bad taste was the photography costs.
Honestly, they are in heaven, and of our group of 17 people, only two bought the photos.

RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDATION
TAKE YOUR PHOTOS! Even if they forbid you, do it because they will take an eye out of your face for them! If I had read the comments before, I would have listened to them.

Sadly, and this is where you can see the business, they don't let you take your cell phone with you, they even have signs prohibiting you from using it for photographs, in case the attraction is not cheap and apart from that they charge you for very expensive photos, and you only get them send to your cell phone
In other words, a package of photos to your cell phone for $1,900, or photos plus video for $2,900!!!!! Don't invent!
The worst thing is that you cannot take a memory of that moment with you because it is very expensive.
I ended up not enjoying it anymore because in the end
I couldn't take my photo with me, something that without a doubt I think many also go. If you take the beautiful experience but the memory or the photo where could you show your relatives and acquaintances?
Zero on that.",10 months ago,"We appreciate your comments, we are glad that you enjoyed your activity.

The safety and well-being of our guests is our priority. For this reason, we ask you not to use cell phones, cameras, or any device that takes your attention away or requires you to make movements outside of grabbing the handlebars, since you must hold them with both hands during the ride.

The prices of the photographs not only cover the care, maintenance and enrichment of our family of camels, but also give us the opportunity to provide them with the service of expert photographers with professional equipment.

With that said, we appreciate you letting us know. Feel free to contact our photography team if you have any other questions or concerns at customerservicephoto@cabo-adventures.com",2

1334,a year ago,"This trip is well planned out and was an amazing experience so I am giving 5 stars. The downsides I point out do not drop it below 5 stars but I want people to know my full experience.They pick you up from your hotel in a nice van shared with a few others, the driver was very nice and opened the door for us. They ask for a tip here (Tip 1). I‚Äôm pointing out the tips because I did not bring enough cash since I didn‚Äôt know we would have to be tipping so many different people in a prepaid excursion.You arrive at the Cabo adventure headquarters in the marina and you check into your trip and wait for everyone to arrive. During this time you can use the clean bathrooms, watch dolphins in the tank, or have a coffee or other drink/food from their small coffee shop.Next you meet your tour guide (ours was the very happy/positive Michelle) and load the bus where you are offered a delicious meat/cheese/tomato/lettuce/cucumber sandwich for breakfast, it was actually really good even without condiments.During the bus ride Michelle educated everyone on whale sharks and what to expect for the day and answered questions. The bus ride was comfortable and had a good view. You have to trip Michelle and the bus driver separately here. (Tip 2).Once we arrived we changed into our wet suits, used the bathroom, and put our bags in storage. Then we loaded the boat where they had towels, fins, and goggles with snorkels. They didn‚Äôt have enough fins for everyone on the boat so we had to switch off. The boat was very crowded and kinda hard to move around. **id recommend bringing your own towel to leave on shore because all there towels got soaked. The water is cold so you‚Äôll want a dry towel to help change into your clothes you brought. There isn‚Äôt much room in the bathroom to change though.We brought our own go pro to use which worked well to get our own photos if you can‚Äôt afford the 50 dollar ones they offer.We got three swims in each and some people did more than that. It was a workout trying to keep up with them and very hard to see them since the water was so cloudy but when you get the chance to finally see them it‚Äôs magical. There was also dolphins that had my husband jumping into the boat with no ladder.Each boat has a tour guide that gets in the water with you and is the photographer/videographer as well as the captain who drives the boat. Each boat only gets one shark so stick to the shark you have since they don‚Äôt want to overwhelm one shark.David was our guide in the water. (Tip 3 - water tour guide and captain).You get off the boat cold and wet so you change and warm up in the sun while eating fish tacos. They were good. I recommend bringing pesos because the bar there only let you use card if your order is over 300 pesos and I used dollars and they gave me the wrong change back. I was missing about 4 dollars. (Tip 4- the people who cooked the fish tacos provided from the tour).We then stop at hotel California for about 20 ish minutes. Walk around and got some good Oreo ice cream and a okay coffee.Then you return to Cabo adventures if you want or the main large coach bus can take you back to your hotel/or the same smaller van.Overall it was a very long fun day. The team as a whole was very nice and knowledgeable. I just wish I brought more cash for all the different tips and a dry towel.You can bring stuff on the boat but it might get lost or wet so id leave as much as you can locked up on shore.",,,5

Everyone was so nice and while I was the only single person with everyone else being couples, I was included and welcomed still. 5 stars for the experience. The reason for only 3 stars is as follows:The photographer was amazing and captured really amazing images and videos - which I purchased. They put them on a flash drive for me and when I got back home to the states and plugged it into my computer, however, the one video that was of me swimming underwater with the dolphin was not on the flash drive. I emailed the business and got a response saying I would have to email someone else, which I did. I told them that the video was missing and they responded & told me to look more closely on my phone, but the photographer and I had already discussed it and that my phone would not work for them, which is why I purchased the flash drive instead in the first place. I responded telling them this, and they just never responded back.I'm super disappointed - it was a really incredible video that I would have loved to share with my family to show them my experience.",2 years ago,"Thank you for your amazing review and comments, especially regarding the service you received from our team members.Regarding the missing video, please share with us all your information at marketing@cabo-adventures, in order to help you recovering your video and pictures.All of us here at Cabo Adventures look forward to welcoming you back soon and creating more unforgettable memories together.",3

1374,3 months ago,Isaac was great. Would have liked a little more beach riding...,,,5
1375,2 months ago,We did an ATV tour with Damien. It was so much fun!,,,5
1376,a year ago,"Please read before you book ANYTHING with Cabo adventures.TLDR:  there are so many additional hidden fees that you end up paying so much more than the original paid ticket - Overall, I paid $175 (vs $104 listed ticket price online) for the ‚Äúcombo‚Äù ticket of eco farm, ATV and camel ride and it was absolutely NOT worth it. The company really tries to squeeze as much money out of the customer - to describe each step in more detail:1) Initial booking - price and additional hidden feesI saw the combo ticket online for $104 (at an advertised 30% discount). When I went to check out the total price ended up being about $120 with additional fees, taxes, etc. After I booked the ticket, I see in the email an additional $20 is required for ‚Äúpark entrance fees‚Äù. I‚Äôm thinking that this must be a huge park where you can roam around if they‚Äôre requiring another fee on top of the price of the ticket. This was not the case - the entrance fee does NOT get you anything else,  it really is just another way to get additional dollars after the initial payment. I get to the location and was told that I had to pay an additional $35 per person (if we each wanted our own vehicle to ride) for ‚ÄúATV insurance.‚Äù I thought this was a payment we would get back as long as there were no damages to the vehicle but thats not the case - it‚Äôs really just another way to get more money. These types of things should already be built into the initial price! So for each person, it was an additional $55 on top of the $120 I paid online which brings the grand total to $175 per person (vs the initial $104 sticker price - 70% higher!). Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have minded too much about the price if the excursion was actually worth it! Surprise surprise - it‚Äôs not.2) 1st activity - EcofarmThis is an absolute joke of an excursion. This is literally a 20 minute tour of their ‚Äúecofarm‚Äù which goes through how to make paper out of camel poop and how to make chocolate. No - we did not get to do any of that process or even see it in action- the tour guide literally spoke so fast and it was not interactive at all. Only pro - you get a small piece of chocolate at the end3) 2nd activity - camel ridingThis was a laughable excursion as well. I thought we‚Äôd be riding camels through various sceneries - no we literally got on the camels, walked along the beach, circled back and then dismounted. Whole riding time was 15 minute, 20 minutes MAX. What did we do after ? For the next 20 min, we sat in a gazebo area where we were told some random camel facts and took turns having the photographer take pictures of us with a camel and of course they didn‚Äôt allow us to use our own cameras because they want to charge you later for the photos. More details on aggregious upsells later.3) 3rd activity - ATVThis was the most ‚Äúworth‚Äù activity. We spent about 30-40 minutes on the ATV and I enjoyed this activity (but definitely not $175 / person worth)4) They are constantly trying to sell you thingsAfter the ATV, a little less than 3 hours have passed. For the final hour, you were brought to the dining and photo area. You also weren‚Äôt allowed to leave early unless you drove there yourself. So for an hour - they would sell you on photos (starting at $150 - $250 for a photo package) and on expensive food and alcohol. After about 45 minutes of waiting around in this dining area, we did the tequila tasting - you get to try 3 different types of tequila which I did enjoy.Overall, it was definitely not worth the money. Where does all the money go? It goes towards marketing - Cabo adventures advertisements are plastered everywhere in Cabo -  from my hotel lobby, to grocery stores, to multiple stands in the touristy areas.Word to the wise - these types of excursions are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper if you negotiate with the tourist vendors at the beach / near the touristy areas. With the $175, I could have probably gotten 3-4 really solid excursions. I know for next time to definitely not go with Cabo adventures and just wait till I land to book these excursions.",,,1

1387,a year ago,We had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the dolphin experience.  We were looking forward to seeing our pictures and were unfortunately super disappointed with the pricing.

Over $500 for our family of 7 that did this tour.,a year ago,"Thank you for taking the time to share your honest experience with us at Cabo Dolphins. We are glad to read this educational and interactive session with our dolphin and marine mammal specialist was a fun experience for you.

Our prices are competitive with other internationally recognized, 5-star dolphinariums similar to our facilities. The money from the swims & photos covers for the care, maintenance, and enrichment for our dolphin family. Furthermore, the profit made from the pictures allows us to do research on marine mammals, and efforts related to rescue, rehabilitation, and release of marine animals in need.

Thank you again for your time and visit. We hope to welcome you back in the near future.",2
1388,a year ago,"My wife and I went on the ""4hr luxury sail boat snorkel adventure"" it was a great time. First of we got picked up by the absolute nicest man named JosË. He spoke wonderful English and was unbelievably friendly. He showed us his favorite spots and some really interesting information on the way to the adventure meeting spot. Next we checked into the adventure and the main building is very professional and clean. Our guides for the day showed up they were also very nice. First mate Victor and captain Jose. Victor was the ""entertainment"", the bar tender and basically the voice of the boat. I thought he did a great job. Captain Jose did fine work also, I was very impressed with the boat controll he had in and out if the harbor but especially at the Arch, there were multiple boats there at the same time one of which was a HUGE yacht and a very large catamaran all literally within 10 ft of each. If you think your going to sail there and back, you will be disappointed. We engined there and halfway back. We dropped sails and actually sailed for about 30 min on the near one hour ride back. However it was very cool to sail. All in all the ride was fun, we met nice other people and the crew was great. I cut my foot on coral and they helped me out nicely. We saw a bunch of cool fish in the one hour of water time. I would recommend this to any one without kids. I would like to go again.",a year ago,"Dear Tim,

1393,a year ago,"I liked the experiences . However the employees are definitely trained to be more like salesmen than actual tourism experts which is  a shame . We did the camel tour , boat tour , and atv tour . In the ATV and camel tour we were prohibited to use our cell phones . During the ATV tour , I was not driving , yet the asssigned photographer made it a point to stop the tour to reprimand me for bringing my phone out saying I will be kicked out of the tour for using my phone , yet I was not driving the vehicle at all which I found extremely unnecessary  . Also during the boat tour had an unpleasant experience with the photographer on the boat tour she was very problematic and felt the need to make us feel bad for not looking at photos while we were asking for directions to get back to our hotel as we had covid tests scheduled and that was our priority, it wasnít buying photos . Such a shame because  the rest of tour guides were very pleasant , the company shouldnít force the photographers to feel as they should treat their guests this  way . Times are changing , we all carry our smart phones and itís a known fact , no need to make a big scene if a person uses their smart phone on vacation , also no need for photographers to be rude when we ask them a question not related to buying photos . Overall , please stop stressing it on your employees that making a sale with photos is more important than the customer experience . No need to shame people who have their phones on them , and no need for photographers be so focused on making a sale that theyíre so rude to their customers",,,1

1413,a year ago,"Had a good time . Did multiple tours , and in all 3 tours , photographers were rude and demanding . We weren‚Äôt allowed to have our phones on us because it would take away from their business . On one of the tours the photographer was polite , however on two other tours . The photographers were jerks . One stopped the tour because he saw I had my phone out and proceeded to threaten me saying I would be kicked out of the tour for having my phone on me . On another tour a lady was very rude because we asked for directions back to our hotel instead of looking at the photo package she was selling , If you look at other reviews , packages run for 300 which is very excessive , considering we all carry smartphones now . It‚Äôs a shame , the rest of the employees treated us with respect , but unsure of why the photographers felt the need to be so agressive when trying to sell their photos . I am assuming the company doesn‚Äôt pay them enough that they feel the pressure to behave this way towards people on their tours in order to make commission . It really felt very predatory",,,1

1420,a year ago,"OK so we had a great time with the dolphin experience! Where I draw the line is after you do the dolphin experience, they take you to see your photos and videos. Once you are emotionally tied up to the experience, this is when The eye gouging begins.  The cheapest photo package was $199. The second photo package was $234 including your videos. Why not keep the photo and video package a little more affordable so people can take that experience with them. The cost of the dolphin experience ranges from $200-$250, and then they want to charge you $234 to get the photos. This is a $500 experience. I understand the value of taking photos And videos with you about $250 extra is a bit extreme.  I will remember it a lifetime. My suggestion to this place is lower your price from $100-$150 range including photos and videos. You will get more customers and people will be able to take their memories with them hence doubling the free marketing. Also have packages when people can choose three or four pictures, making it more customizable.

After a bit,  they turned around and headed back √†nd then turned back for a  beautiful sunset.  On the way back they turned off the motor and raised the jib sail and sailed back to the harbor. As we approached the harbor they dropped the sail and motored in and parked. The only down fall was the snack  and the fact that once you left the boat  you were on your own to find the shuttle bus.

1469,a year ago,"Talk about a company that chooses profit over people. We had 3 activities scheduled with them (Parasailing, Dolphins, and a Sunset Cruise).The parasailing was great, it was short and sweet. We didn't need to be up in the sky for that long anyway so it was nice. They offered to take pictures with our phones and also stopped by the Arch since we had some extra time to get a close up view of it and take some more pictures as well. Transportation was quick and prompt.Unfortunately the Dolphin encounter seemed like a setup to take your money. No phones or cameras were allowed. We arrived, same like we did for the parasailing. The experience with the dolphin was great and they seemed like they were well taken care of. Even the instructor was awesome as well. The biggest downfall there was how much they wanted to charge you for the pictures. The lowest price started at $150 (bear in mind they do not allow you to choose individual photos either) they force you purchase all of the photos and videos, which either forces you to buy it all or go home empty handed. It was disaster leaving the photo center. So many people felt like they were being robbed for the photo prices that even some of the people we're leaving in tears because of the memories they weren't going to be able to take home with them. It just felt wrong on so many levels. They have the sense of knowing that not many will be able to have such a special moment again with animal like that so they feel they can charge you extortion prices. Unfortunately my fianc√© and I will never be able to share those memories again or just to look at. (Just something to bear in mind before you make the decision to go here)Our last activity with them was the Sunset Sailing Cruise. There was a storm that was coming on Sunday, our tour was on Saturday evening. They didn't even bother to call or let us know that they hand cancelled the activity on us. We ended up waiting about an half hour before we were told that it was cancelled after we called. So now we don't even get the chance to experience our biggest activity that we were looking forward to the most..Now we wait to see if we even get our refund back...Thank you Cabo Adventures.",a year ago,"Dear Justin Linares,Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience with us, we appreciate your feedback.

1471,a year ago,"We did the zip line excursion. It was an 80-minute drive from the docks in an air-conditioned van to the destination. Pet peeves #1 - sign in the van asking for tips. We paid almost $500 for our family group of six to do this excursion and now you want us to pay the driver separately?!Pet peeve #2 - they do not allow any cameras, including cell phones, so that they can take the only photos of your trip and try to charge you $200+ at the end for the photos! Sheesh!! Also at the end they are asking for more tips for all of the tour guides. I hate that! Those things knocked off two stars from my rating.The zip-line experience itself was fantastic!The ""snack"" at the end (hand made tortillas, salsa, guacamole, potatoes, chilis, salad, etc.) was fantastic!

Oliver explained all about the conservancy and about the sharks and let us know what to expect.  Our guide, Erik, made sure we all had a good time and gave special attention to some passengers who had more trouble in the water.  He also took fantastic photos and video.The only thing to keep in mind is that this tour is closer to 12 hours than 8 as you have to factor in transportation from your hotel to the dolphin center in the morning.  The return can be pretty late depending on how much time you spend in the water.  Take snacks and be patient and it'll be an unforgettable day!",,,5
1476,3 years ago,Words can not do justice to having a close encounter with a dolphin.  I had an exceptional visit with these amazing creatures and for others who respect the experience I would highly recommend doing it too.  The trainer was very kind and helpful.  The facility was lovely.  It was well worth the money.  In fact spend your tourist dollars at places like this.

1485,a year ago,Tourist trap. Waste of time and money. Not worth the effort.  Camel ride was maybe 10 min. Outback adventure was a short trail through the garden (maybe 5 minute walk).

Both Michelle & David were very attentive to everyone's needs throughout the tour by making sure that we were properly fed, and had enough towels and water. We also loved the additional 30-minute stop in Todos Santos on the way back to break up the drive, which allowed us to check out Hotel California and grab some ice cream.Things to expect: 5-hour round-trip to La Paz for the dive. ~ 3 hours on the boat with an intimate group with opportunity for multiple entries to swim with the whale sharks.

The facility did provide a photographer, but the prices are outrageous ! My friends and I were offer a package with all the pictures and video they took for 200 dollars! Mind you, we‚Äôve already spent around 300+ dollars to do this activity which was swimming with the dolphins and now they were trying to sell us our memories. I understand this is how they make their income, but in our previous activities we were able to purchase individual pictures and were not forced to pay the entire photo package in order to get the pictures we like. Because my friends were not interested in their pictures I was singled out to pay the 200 dollar price for ALL OF OUR pictures and they told me they were unable to separate my pictures from the others, but if I waited to purchase my pictures online, then I was able to purchase them individually. Of course this was the only option I had because I was not about to purchase  a 200 dollar photo package where there was only about two pictures I liked, so I waited to get home to purchase my pictures. Here is were they began to lose stars from me. When I visited their webpage our pictures were not uploaded. I emailed customer service and I  told them the pictures from our tour were not uploaded and if there was a way I can purchase my pictures. They replied back stating that the website has not been working for about a month and if I wanted to purchase my pictures I would HAVE TO PAY THE 200 dollar photo package!! What!?

There is an air-conditioned gift shop just below the viewing area where we were able to bring our baby who didn‚Äôt enjoy the humidity. There‚Äôs also Starbucks coffee! The staff in the photo area was extremely friendly and very efficient. We just received all of our packages just a couple days after coming home from our trip.The photos are beautiful and I am so glad that somebody was there to capture these memories.

1528,a year ago,"My boyfriend and I did the snorkeling in Cabo Pulmo and it was an adventure. We had a 2 hour drive from Cabo San Lucas which was in a clean and cool sprinter van. When snorkeling the guide led us to 4 different spots and we were able to see various fishes even sea turtle and manta ray! Boat ride was rocky and I did get seasick but my boyfriend was able to manage, just as a heads up for those who are first timers! Even people in our group who are well experienced in snorkeling before were getting queasy. But overall, Cabo adventures provided what was promised in description and we had a great time.

1539,a year ago,"The service is fine, but for the prices that are in dollars it could improve, by the way, I recommend putting the prices of transportation in pesos (we are in Mexico). I noticed that the quality has dropped compared to previous years (before they offered snacks and they passed you through the arch on routes that they don't now, the neoprene suits they lent us were torn). It is important to mention that on the way back they do not accompany you from the port to the facilities and although the journey is short we saw a couple from another country who was taken by people who were in the port and they thought they were from the tour (they must accompany them back).",,,3
1540,a year ago,"The experience is good in general, but they don't let you use your camera for photos or your cell phone.

1557,2 years ago,"My partner and I participated in the Sunset Sailing. The scenery and vibes were amazing, however in the first 30 minutes we both got sea sick and threw up the remainder of the ride. The tides were very strong and it was not a pleasant experience. The staff was truly amazing. They gave us both water, and ice chips to help with the sickness. We wish we could have really enjoyed the experience more but our bodies did not like the sea. Never again lol.P.S. I would recommend eating hours before and not the food the provided.

The trainers are amazing, dolphins well cared for and we had fun.However,  the minute the experience was over and we were show to get our pictures is why I would not reccomend doing this excursion with your family.  They want $400 for your pictures folks. There is NO option to pick a photo, you have to buy them all. The $400 was THE cheapest option folk, and it was for a digital download to your phone.It ruined the entire experience for my family.

They lend you a towel to dry off and there are showers to rinse off. He carries very few things. Since the locker to store them is small and it takes money to lend you the locker, at the end they will return it to you, when you hand over the key to it. Do not wear any jewelry, you cannot go swimming with the dolphin if you are wearing jewelry.

We also took the camel ride, still very good service, very friendly staff, especially a great appreciation to Bill, Isha, Jairo, Antonio, Carlos, David, congratulations for having such good staff.

Checking things off my bucket list.Front staff not very friendly or attentive.The trainer and dolphins were top notch.I ordered the premium photo package which was almost $250. They promised it would be delivered to my hotel the next day. That never happened. I got it in the mail at home, 11 days after leaving Mexico.  I sent emails and really never got an apology or explanation.There was supposed to be an optional fast boat ride out to the arches. It was never mentioned and definitely never happened.Overall it was a great day, I just don't know why the photographer lied.

1572,a year ago,"BEWARE: MONEY STOLENI booked multiple Cabo Adventure tours in May 2021. After booking, I nearly immediately canceled part of it, well within the refund period (they have a generous full refund policy). However, I was told the refund would take 60 business days (3 months) to process. After this period passed, I've been in near constant contact with the company and have been given every excuse imaginable as to why my refund wasn't processed. I was seriously told once that the weather was bad so they couldn't process the refund. I've been told the company doesn't have money to refund, the Bank of Mexico is holding up the refund, and the ""Finance Department"" isn't issuing refunds for the time being. It's been nearly 4 months and while they have acknowledged I am owed refund, they have yet to let it go through. I'm out hundreds of dollars and have opened a dispute with one of the major U.S. banks that handled the transaction.As for the tours I attended, I would say they were average / ok, but were very cheap so I'm not going to complain about the quality. If you're 100% sure your plans wont change, this company might work for you, but there is a 0% chance you will ever see a penny if your plans change.",a year ago,"Dear parker monterubio,Thank you for sharing your experience with us, I'm sorry but we do not have a reservation under your name, and we are not sure if you booked with us, we ask you to please contact us at your earliest convenience at reservations@cabo-adventures.com with your reservation details to offer the proper follow up asap.Thank you,",1

1577,2 years ago,"I did the whale shark swim with this company.  I had a great time, our tour guide did a great job.  I can't remember his name, but he's tall with short hair and into rock climbing.  I feel like this guide truly cared about the conservation of the whale sharks and was very informative about the species.  Sometimes people claim they care about the conservation but don't really SHOW IT.  This guy showed it, he was passionate about the safety of the animal.  When I originally scheduled I scheduled for Feb, 14.  My plans ended up changing due to a cancelation from an unrelated scuba diving shop, and I walked down to the Cabo Adventures building in the Marina and they were happy to rearrange my date to Feb 15, in order to accommodate my scuba diving with the other company.  They didn't try to charge me extra or give any hassle.  They just said ""Let me see if I have a spot open.  Yes, I do."" and I was changed over and good to go.  I appreciate the ease with that.  I had signed up for hotel transport, but I was staying in the Marina so they said to walk down to the shop instead (like a 4 minute walk) which was fair.  The location of the shop is convenient if you are staying around the Marina.  It's also nice and clean inside.  So I waited for 15 minutes until the group and guide were all there and we boarded a shuttle to La Paz.  They gave us a bagged sandwich, chips, and some juice for the ride.  I didn't expect that and it was nice.  The lunch that was provided at the restruant was also good.  It was a cute little restruant and we sat at tables in the sand of the little beach.  I enjoyed the food.  We did see one whale shark and were able to swim with it 5-6 times.  They took a video with a go pro, but the water was really murky ( that's all dependent on mother nature).  They offer to sell you the video and some pictures at the end but it is WAY overpriced.  $50 for some go pro clips where you could barely see the shark!  They offer to put it on a zip drive and the zip drive is pretty much the cheapest quality zip drive on the existence of the earth.  It looks like the overhead on that is probably around $2.50.  You guys need to be more reasonable on the videos and pics and not try to start out with some ungodly high price for it- (marketing trick).  Anyhow, I really enjoyed the excursion.   I saw the beautiful giant of the sea very close up.  I had a great lunch.  All in all it was a fantastic day that will be in my memories forever!",2 years ago,Dear V SThank you for your comments regarding our Whale Shark Encounter.

1584,4 years ago,"We did the Dolphin Adventure and loved the experience.  Everyone took a turn with a quick lap and we got to see some tricks.  Our dolphin wasn't really having it.  He was ""distracted"" so they didn't push him to do the tricks and brought another dolphin out. What is truly disappointing about the experience is afterwards finding out how much it costs to do their photo packages.  It was over $350 because we were 3 small groups together as a group of 9.  The pictures are taken by the staff and are beginner level at best so most of the photos weren't great, but there were a few good shots we would have loved to purchase but they don't sell them separately.  I am heart broken to have had such a wonderful experience and no photos to cherish.  Beware of the photo price! The experience is short and sweet and nothing to show for it. Sad!",,,1

On the third try we got someone who told us a different time then the email they finally sent out 8hrs prior.

They have lockers, but it is easier to just bring a water tight bag and pack light. Everything is provided. While you're Snorkeling, kayaking, and paddle boarding your stuff will be safe in the boat.

1603,3 years ago,"Do NOT book with this company. If I could give them 0 stars I would. They ruined our honeymoon! We booked at the resort with one of their representatives. We wanted to book two excursions but she convinced us to do this deal that was 3 for the price of two. We were not really interested in anything else but picked one just because it was free. Well we only got to attend 1 of the 3 and tried to get a refund before the 48hr cut off. They did not refund us, they still continue to give us the run around even if itís been months. We lots close to 1000$ CAD. Happy Honeymoon to us.

Also the only one we attended was  the Cabo snorkel and lands end arch, it was terrible. They advertise it as on lovers beach but itís no where near that. Itís also so deep where they off load you that you donít see barely any fish! It was horrible experience.

The other observers I talked to there agreed, and they even went as far as placing extra staff in your line of sight between you and the groups while they were interacting with the dolphins.If you want good pictures of the experience, expect to pay a minimum of $140+ for a package.

1634,9 months ago,"We were extremely disappointed with the Outback and Camel Safari and feel we wasted our day attending. It was NOTHING like the description in the catalog provided to us - ‚ÄúLive an amazing eco-adventure in the countryside of Baja California. Take a nature walk then board an open-all, 4x4 military-style Unimog to continue deeper into the rugged Baja outback. View ancient cacti that live in the sandy pathways, and keep an eye out for chipmunks, foxes, deer and 'caracara"" falcons who live and hide in the desert. Next, ride a camel along the beach at Rancho San Cristobal, enjoying breathtaking views of the ocean.‚Äù The catalog also stated to bring ‚ÄúSwimsuit and towel for the cenote‚Äù.We were picked up from our hotel at our scheduled time for the hour long drive to the park. They promptly checked us in as soon as we arrived and told us our tour was scheduled to start in 30 minutes. A while later one of the guides came out and mentioned that a group from another hotel was running late. They proceeded to take us through presentations about plastic recycling, donkeys, goats, and finally cocoa beans. Once these presentations were completed, we waited about 10 minutes before another set of guides came out to split everyone in 2 groups. From this point on, cameras and cell phones were forbidden. They walked us to some benches to educate us about camels and wait for everyone in our group (about 17 people) to take several group and individual pictures with a camel. A few people complained to our guide Bill about the amount of time wasted up to this point. After a brief safety briefing and helmet fitting, we mounted the camels and walked up and down the beach for about 20 minutes. They fed us lunch outdoors (with no shortage of flies) and gave us a few shots of tequila before loading us on the back of a truck to take us to the exit. When our driver picked us up to return us to the hotel, we asked about stopping at the cenote. He said that portion of the trip was canceled due to rain making it too muddy. Turns out there are no cenotes in Los Cabos! Based on the catalog, this was supposed to be a 4 hour trip plus transportation. The van ride was an hour each way.

1652,2 years ago,"Booked the sunset cruise to see the arches with my friend. We are in our late 20s. Hotel pickup/drop off was as expected. Signs urging for tips in the bus was tacky.  Arriving at the Cabo adventures building was a bit chaotic, so I'm glad our driver told us where to go as there were many people and tours gathering. We then took a very sunny, 5 min walk to the boat. It was about a 40 foot sailboat and the best views were on the front of the boat. I'm 5""9 160 lbs and found the seating to be cramped for over a two hour trip. I had a tiny slice of cushion to myself and my butt was numb after about 15 min. No back support, felt like I had less of a personal bubble than on an airplane. My friend had a lady keep bumping shoulders with her and I could barely stretch out my legs and relax without having to move them to let the tour guide walk by. The worst part, and a big part of my low rating, is the fact that there is this obnoxious photographer on board taking photos throughout the trip. It felt forced and was quite intrusive to have to keep smiling at this random lady so she could take photos we weren't the least bit interested in buying. It felt like I was the bride at a wedding there were so many photos taken. After the first 45 minutes or so she got the hint and stopped forcing us to pose. The food was not great. Guac with store bought chips, tasteless pasta salad, salad with a couple grape tomatoes, and bread.  Lettuce kept flying off my plate. And trying to drink on the boat was a joke, kept spilling on myself and I hadn't had any alcohol before the boat. They gave everyone a welcome mimosa and then took drink orders. The wine left lots to be desired. Music on the boat was too loud and the same songs were on repeat. I heard one song three times! Overall, despite the great views the atmosphere wasn't what I was hoping for. I wanted to sit back, relax and chat with my friend. But it was too loud, cramped, and felt like I had paparazzi around me.",2 years ago,"Hello Megan,Thank you for taking the time to share your honest experience on our Luxury Sunset Sailing.

The tour company took obvious efforts to ensure that the boat was well sanitized and that the passengers abided by safety precautions.We loved the food (exceptional ceviche, shrimp & guacamole among other great items), the drinks (wide selection, plentiful, and excellently made), the sailing (the boat was high quality, and picked up impressive speed while feeling safe & secure), as well as the time spent snorkeling (beautiful fish, and even a Tortuga). We appreciated the photo opportunity next to the Cabo Arch / Lover's Beach.All-in-all, this made for a wonderful, memorable day that was well worth the value.

Two days before our trip I confirmed with Cabo Adventures that we had reservations still they said yes. Then the day of our excursion we waited in the lobby of our hotel to be picked up only to find out they canceled our trip due to my dispute of the one charge, mind you they still charged us the first charge which I did not dispute. So not only did we not get to go on our tours we were charged and I had to go through my credit card company to get a refund.

1680,2 years ago,"We took 2 tours with them. The first one, diving in Cabo Pulmo was amazing even though we had to wait for 25min for the driver to pick up us. The second one, diving in the arc,  started with the wrong foot, we were supposed to be picked up at 7:15am, we reached out to the guide and he told us that they would be 15min late, so we had a little bit of time to finish breakfast, out surprise was when got to the lobby the driver had left (btw, is was the same one we had the day before), they didn‚Äôt even had the courtesy to give us call. You are paying a high amount of money and expecting a great service. Another complain is that we brought 75% of the diving gear and we were still force to pay the full amount, 140$ only to use fins and bcd.

1681,5 years ago,"I did two tours while I was in Cabo over the weekend with Cabo Adventures.First tour - Camel & Outback adventure. Janet was our guide and she was amazing. She led us on a small hike and taught us ""how to survive in the desert"" she was comical and incredibly knowledgeable which made the tour great. The Camel ride while brief (about 20-25 minutes) was unforgettable, of course they take professional photos which run about 24 USD if you want one but a couple came out great and I figured it was worth it for the memory. The tequila tasting and food were a great wrap up at the end.The second tour I did was the Signature Swim with Dolphins, this is why I deducted a star, the experience itself was amazing, Rachel was our trainer and again she was fun, sweet and super knowledgeable. At the end there was only one photo I really liked and wanted to purchase but was super thrown off when I was told they ONLY offered packages...starting at $140... this made me a little upset as you do shell out a bit of money for the excursion and you can't purchase a single photo but have to pay almost as much for photos as you do for the adventure itself. Glad I did it but sad I don't have a photo as memory.",,,4

1683,6 years ago,"We booked our swimming with the dolphins on the website while in America.  They were running a promo for buy one get one free.  It was very easy to book and they send you a confirmation to your email.  Cabo Adventures was able to pick us up at the hotel and take us to the pool.  (One way ONLY).When we got there we were able to get checked in.  They do have lockers for you to keep your belongings while you are in the pool.  They do NOT allow you to bring in any of your own cameras.We signed up for the biggest dolphin package.  Most of the other people had got a smaller package.  We were so happy because there was only 3 in our group and we were able to swim with the dolphins for about an hr.  We got to play/pet them along with 2 rides each.  I did one underwater and one above water.  They were so fast!Overall, this is the easiest company to do excursions.  They seemed a bit more expensive than some of the others, and I'm guessing because of all of the marketing costs.",,,5
1684,5 years ago,"Booked 3 adventures with Cabo Adventures. Bought two adventures got the third for free!

The afternoon sailing trip was perfect.
The boat had plenty of space, the tour guides and service were great. It was a perfect blend of relaxation and excitement. The boat was in great condition and the option to paddle board or snorkel is a nice touch. They provide a  good light lunch and plenty of drinks.

Important note, make sure you understand the shuttle times. The shuttle back to hotels is every two hours starting at noon. We missed our shuttle so had to wait almost two hours for the next one. Good thing is you can check out the marina plaza while waiting for the next shuttle. Their facilities are located on the marina plaza.

Leo is an awesome tour guide.

Dolphin swim was awesome!!! Better than expected and worth every cent.. My wife and I had a great time. The staff were great, facilities are awesome and the dolphins swim was a true life experience.. Weíve swam with Dolphins before on other vacations and this was the best by far... highly recommended :)

Note: the pictures are a little pricey, so be prepared if you want them!

Off road Polaris side by side excursion.
It was awesome. They took us to an off road trail in the desert and along Baja race trails. The machines are awesome, 900cc, new 2017 units. The trail was up and down mountain sides, through a river, got totally wet and along a beach on the ocean. Lots of turns and different terrain. Got to open them up as well.
Iíve done theses excursions in Cancun but this was the best by far!!! Guides are awesome.
I totally recommend it, suggest bringing a change of clothes though fir the trip back.
Travel to and from about 45 mins.. provided a good lunch on the beach too.

Thank you Cabo Adventures, it was a great time!!!!

Thank you

1686,11 months ago,"The experience with the dolphins is majestic and unforgettable. I highly recommend it, the trainer Erik is super fun. The bad thing is that the photos are very expensive and they don't give you many options, on the contrary, the prices go up more, so if you go, don't waste your time posing for the photos ?? because they don't let you in with your cell phone either",11 months ago,"We appreciate your comments about your experience with us at Cabo Dolphins. The well-being of our dolphins and the safety of the guests during the program is our main priority; For this reason, we do not allow cameras, cell phones, jewelry, or any other items in the dolphin habitat. We offer an optional photography service and a viewing area, in which non-swimmers can catch those magical moments.

Our photography prices are standardized and competitive with other internationally recognized 5-star dolphinariums, similar to our facilities. Resources raised through photos help provide care, maintenance, and enrichment for our dolphin family, conduct marine mammal research, conservation-related efforts such as rescue, rehabilitation, and release of marine animals in need, as well as allows us to provide you with well-trained professional photographers and the best aquatic equipment to capture that once-in-a-lifetime moment.

1687,2 years ago,"From the reservation process (online) I had a good experience. At all times the information and prices were clear and without tricks. A few hours before the tour (Camels), I received an email with clear instructions on the place and time in which we would start our adventure.

The guide assigned to us was very respectful, entertaining and fun. Before starting our camel safari, we went through a couple of educational pavilions with a dynamic suitable for children and adults.

I honestly expected the camel tour to be shorter, so I was satisfied.

To close with a flourish, a rich Mexican meal with handmade tortillas.

The only thing I did not like is that the price of the photo package is very expensive, yes, you are not forced to buy it.

Finally, it is noteworthy that all hygiene and safety measures are complied with",2 years ago,"Dear Laura,

1690,a year ago,"I booked a jet ski tour in Cabo and had to cancel due to the waters being really rough.  When I sent the email, because no one answered when I called, they said I didn't cancel in time and didn't want to refund my money.  After I fought about that and told them about the water, then they said they didn't get a report from the port but indeed it was rough and they would refund my money in 40 BUSINESS DAYS.  WTH.  The other companies that I purchased excursions with refunded my money before I left to come home but 40 BUSINESS DAYS, I've never heard of such mess.  I call and ask about my refund, the lady says they are processing them now but then mentioned I wasn't getting a refund.

1700,5 years ago,We took two tours the glass bottom boat was good.  The sailboat dinner cruise food was not really edible too salty and spicy. The crew was only 3 people and the guide was the only one active in the crew.  The captain was waiter and dishwasher so the boat just went adrift for 1/2 the time.  Then the pictures they took were 50 USD for less than 10 pics whether you wanted 1 or all and were on flash drive so more expense when u get home.  Very disappointed that our money was more important the we were.  The all day trip taken by our friends swim with the sharks had better food according to them and had a lot more pictures taken and the pictures were only $40 it would be nice to have some consistency in pricing.

The sailing itself was fun, but we snorkeled in a very foggy area and then we didn‚Äôt get to paddleboard even though others were out paddleboarding. I guess the waves were too strong?

1707,2 years ago,"We hired a snorkel tour. They offer this at different times. I contracted it online for which I got a discount. I also requested the transfer from the hotel which arrived 10 minutes after the time indicated by the same agency. However, we arrived in time to register for the activity. As expected in the place they offer souvenirs and drinks (coffee, soft drinks among others). A 354ml soda costs 36 pesos. Prior to the activity, the guide met those who were going to take that activity. They provided us with fins and a neoprene suit due to the temperature of the water. After this they told us where to embark inside the marina. It was a roofless boat with capacity for 10 people. The trip started towards the arch of Cabo San Lucas and from there we returned to snorkel. The guide indicated the snorkel area. The current did not favor carrying out the activity, however, there was an opportunity to do it in another area. The contracted package included a snack and water, which was provided to us at the end of the tour. At the end, we meet with other clients for the return to our respective hotels. The transfer was really fast. I bought a souvenir, the prices are in dollars despite being in Mexico. I didn't like that, however, the experience was good.","

Great music and great vibes to meet other people!!",a year ago,"Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about Cabo Adventures.

1714,2 years ago,"Americans Please Be Aware of Dolphin Photo Scam! Do Not Pay That fee you will be disappointed!! No refunds!! Lies about choosing pictures of choice for photo book! Most pictures eyes were either closed or poor quality. Strangers will be in photos, videos. NO RESPONSE From Cabo Adventure Customer  Service  Number.Our very first time in Mexico and as I would say I enjoyed the other excursions. My dolphin experience was extremely Upsetting. Our dolphin was injured and clearly in pain so therefore I was bummed about that. They brushed off the injuries and said the dolphins fight often.2. We had the most rude and unprofessional photographer ever. We were in a group of four so he tried to make it seem we were getting a deal. I requested, to not be charged until after I received my photos (why because they charge $350+ tips USD to photo guy for photos). He agreed over and over to get us to sign and to put our card info, promising a hold on a card versus a charge. He promised that if we didn't like the pictures we can come back to fix any issues and we wouldn't be charged until we confirmed we WANTED them.He didn't  allow us to preview our pictures closely he showed us a couple and said there isn't  much time to view them because  of all the people waiting. I shared the package with the other two in our group. Majority of our pictures were horrible. Eyes closed, poor quality, Not even edited evenly on the pages. The sales guy lied and said we would have our own photos in the book, to my surprise they added all of ours together even included people we didn't know. Included others in our video, Our prints were Paper. Not Photo Paper, Regular Printing Paper who does that? How bizarre. I literally cried. I understand for time some things must be done quickly but to SCAM us. I was extremely upset.Not to mention they lied and delivered our pictures literally a couple of hours of us having to pack to leave.They promised a 24-48hr delivery. So clearly, How could I dispute it if I  had to leave. I called for over 5 months no response from Cabo Adventures before I left. I sat at the airport trying to get a hold of anyone mind you they have a representative(sales guy) at the airport. American passengers  literally were looking through the prints  we got and said you were Scammed.Hopefully, I can get this resolved  with You guys and I would be willing to update my Review. From the past experience  I am not Hopeful anyone Will try to rectify  this and make a customer happy.I am Want my photo book as promised that just had our pictures, or Refund.",2 years ago,"Hello Amanda,Thank you for having taken the time to share your experience with us at Cabo Dolphins. We are glad that you are as passionate about Animal Welfare as we are! Our staff has over 400 years of accumulated experience. We have some of the world‚Äôs best Veterinarians, Biologists, and Scientists working on our team to ensure the highest levels of care and welfare for the dolphins in our family.As the marine mammal specialist explained during your experience, the marks on the dolphin‚Äôs skin are known as ""rake marks"". These are found on all cetaceans, both in the wild and under human care, and are a result of social interactions between individuals. We monitor these marks on a daily basis using a software system, which helps us measure appropriate levels of interaction. I can assure you that at Cabo Dolphins we are well within normal limits. We would love to extend an invitation to you to come and tour our dolphin facilities and to have the opportunity to ask our experts the questions you may have.Regarding the issues you had with the Photography Department, we would like to clarify that there is no added fee to the purchasing of pictures as this is a completely optional service we offer. When acquiring the pictures, the photographer will firstly show you your pictures and then proceed to give you different picture packages. When purchasing them, the photographer will never personally handle your card or money, there is a specific booth where you, personally, can purchase your pictures. Having said this, rest assured we will be looking into this situation. Please reach out to us at customerservicephoto@cabo-adventures.comThank you again for your time and visit, we look forward to hearing from you.",1

1716,2 years ago,We went on a sunset sailing adventure and had a really great time. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because we got ripped off on the picture package after. Other people in our group paid as low as $20 and we ended up paying $80 and we didn't even get the cabo adventures picture frame.,2 years ago,"Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience at Cabo Adventures. We are delighted to read you enjoyed your adventure.

Regarding the pictures, the pricing of each package consists of the number of people in the group, and the type of package .

1717,2 years ago,"My husband and I have scheduled three adventures through Cabo adventures and have completed two thus far. Louis Chichas was our guide on the camel tour and he was the best! So funny and informative. We really enjoyed him. Thank you Carlos for escorting us and Bob Marley (our camel) on the beach walk. We also did the UTV ride through the desert and Juan was our guide on that. He was super as well and very informative. Jose, Gonzalo, fredx, and  zorios were also with us and took amazing pics and were very helpful and informative. Jose, thank you for the awesome pics!!!! Juan took exceptional care of us when we went to eat and hydrate :), thank you!!! Loved everyone in the petting zoo. They were so sweet and informative. I wish I could remember everyone‚Äôs name. Thank you to the young lady that taught us about the camel poop and making paper. Thank you to the gentleman for being so informative about the mules, ponies, and goats. We enjoyed our time with you.  Thank you Pepe for the wonderful chocolate you made and for the mezcal üòÅ. Thank you to the gentleman checking us in for being so welcoming and nice.

1718,a year ago,"Don‚Äôt schedule anything with this place. We signed up for snorkeling and then when we got there, at the last minute when our trip was supposed to go out, they told us that we couldn‚Äôt go and that they had accidentally booked us on someone‚Äôs private snorkel trip. It was too late in the day to schedule anything else, with any company so our last day in Cabo was completely ruined. Did they give me a refund? No. All I got was a business card with a phone number on it. Choose your adventure with some other company",,,1

The crew Christopher ,Pablo and Captain were informative and made sure we saw the most epic display of these creatures. I want to go back to swim with the whale shark. Christopher took amazing photos and we bought them.",,,5
1723,5 years ago,"My family reserved the luxury sailing excursion. The staff was terrific and  entertaining.  Also, there was a photographer on board to take pictures as well. It was worth it. This wasn't a whale watching cruise but sailing back from Santa Maria Bay we saw several Hump backs. Seeing them in person was unbelievable!",,,5
1724,4 years ago,"VERY GOOD WHALE SHARK TOUR WITH ERIC AND OLIVER!!!!!!!

Our drivers were excellent as well (Gil and Our boat driver that I can not spell his name as itís a Spanish name that I was not familiar with)

I HIGHLY recommend Eric. He exhausted himself and kept pushing his own body limits to help us swim with the whale sharks. He helped the best swimmers and the ones who were really struggling. He truly enjoyed making people happy and knowing it was a once in a lifetime experience for most.

A HUGE thank you to the entire team and to Eric for helping us get a chance to see whale sharks.",,,5

The trainer is the best and his Delfin Liz is beautiful. The experience in the water was the best. As a group experience it is very nice, however, being very objective and taking away the fun of coexistence, the waiting time at check-in is brutal, there were only two people in front of me and I was waiting 40 minutes. At the end of the activity, not only me, but all of the group lost because the staff was more interested in guiding us to the photos than to the showers.
Brenda is very good with the camera.

I wish they had a more efficient check in and it would be even better than what is already experience.",2 years ago,"Thank you for your comments regarding our dolphin programs. We are thrilled to read you had a wonderful time and will pass along your comments to our team members. We also appreciate you mentioned the opportunity areas you encountered during your visit; we will consider them in the future.
